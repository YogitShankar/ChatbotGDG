The Scrapper.py file aims to navigate to problems in codeforces site and get information about the problem and store it for further use. After creating basic functions to create directories for storing scraped data , I used the base page as the codeforces problemset page, it contains many problems arranged in a table. Upon inspection, the links for the questions are all in div tags with class = "id", I stored these links in a list. Using a for loop and undetected-chromedriver to avoid human verification pop ups, the program navigates to the problem site and stores important information like problem id, time-limit, memory-limit, problem statement, input and output specifications. This code fails for those questions that have the links redirected to a pdf that has the problem information.
Then I find the link for editorial site, in the site there are tutorials for all the questions of that contest including many hints and solutions. The code searches for all the solutions and stores them in a list then according to the question order in the contest matches it for the question for eg, question id 2043B, then the solution of this will be stored in index 1 of the list. This approach fails to get information about hints as the number of hints varies for each problem and also fails for complex question ids, for eg 2053I2.
The scraped data is stored in different files for problem statements and editorials in data directory
