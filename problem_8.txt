Title: B. Gorilla and the Exam
Statement:
Due to a shortage of teachers in the senior class of the "T-generation", it was decided to have a huge male gorilla conduct exams for the students. However, it is not that simple; to prove his competence, he needs to solve the following problem.
For an array
b
, we define the function
f(b)
as the smallest number of the following operations required to make the array
b
empty:
You are given an array
a
of length
n
and an integer
k
. No more than
k
times, you can choose any index
i
(
1≤i≤n
) and any integer
p
, and replace
ai
with
p
.
Help the gorilla to determine the smallest value of
f(a)
that can be achieved after such replacements.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each set of input data contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤105
,
0≤k≤n
) — the length of the array
a
and the maximum number of changes, respectively.
The second line of each set of input data contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
) — the array
a
itself.
It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of
n
across all sets of input data does not exceed
105
.
For each set of input data, output a single integer on a separate line — the smallest possible value of
f(a)
.
In the first set of input data,
f([48843])=1
, since the array consists of a single number, and thus it can be removed in one operation.
In the second set of input data, you can change the second number to
2
, resulting in the array
[2,2,2]
, where
f([2,2,2])=1
, since you can take the entire array as a subarray, the minimum on it is
2
, so we will remove all the
2
s from the array, and the array will become empty.
