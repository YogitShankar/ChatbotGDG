    "description": "The classic programming language of Bitland is Bit++. This language is so peculiar and complicated.\nThe language is that peculiar as it has exactly one variable, called x. Also, there are two operations:\nA statement in language Bit++ is a sequence, consisting of exactly one operation and one variable x. The statement is written without spaces, that is, it can only contain characters \"+\", \"-\", \"X\". Executing a statement means applying the operation it contains.\nA programme in Bit++ is a sequence of statements, each of them needs to be executed. Executing a programme means executing all the statements it contains.\nYou're given a programme in language Bit++. The initial value of x is 0. Execute the programme and find its final value (the value of the variable when this programme is executed).",
    "input_specification": "The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150) — the number of statements in the programme.\nNext n lines contain a statement each. Each statement contains exactly one operation (++ or --) and exactly one variable x (denoted as letter «X»). Thus, there are no empty statements. The operation and the variable can be written in any order.",
    "output_specification": "Print a single integer — the final value of x.",
