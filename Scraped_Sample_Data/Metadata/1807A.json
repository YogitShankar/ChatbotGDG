    "input_specification": "The first line contains a single integer\nt\n(\n1≤t≤162\n) — the number of test cases.\nThe description of each test case consists of three integers\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\n(\n1≤a,b≤9\n,\n−8≤c≤18\n). The additional constraint on the input: it will be generated so that exactly one of the two equations will be true.",
