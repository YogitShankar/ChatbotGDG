    "description": "The HR manager was disappointed again. The last applicant failed the interview the same way as 24 previous ones. \"Do I give such a hard task?\" — the HR manager thought. \"Just raise number 5 to the power of n and get last two digits of the number. Yes, of course, n can be rather big, and one cannot find the power using a calculator, but we need people who are able to think, not just follow the instructions.\"\nCould you pass the interview in the machine vision company in IT City?",
    "input_specification": "The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·1018) — the power in which you need to raise number 5.",
    "output_specification": "Output the last two digits of 5n without spaces between them.",
