    "description": "Petya loves lucky numbers. We all know that lucky numbers are the positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.\nUnfortunately, not all numbers are lucky. Petya calls a number nearly lucky if the number of lucky digits in it is a lucky number. He wonders whether number n is a nearly lucky number.",
    "input_specification": "The only line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1018).\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit numbers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.",
    "output_specification": "Print on the single line \"YES\" if n is a nearly lucky number. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without the quotes).",
