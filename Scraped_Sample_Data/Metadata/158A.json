Calculate how many participants will advance to the next round.",
    "input_specification": "The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 50) separated by a single space.\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100), where ai is the score earned by the participant who got the i-th place. The given sequence is non-increasing (that is, for all i from 1 to n - 1 the following condition is fulfilled: ai ≥ ai + 1).",
