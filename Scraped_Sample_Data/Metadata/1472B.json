    "description": "Alice and Bob received\nn\ncandies from their parents. Each candy weighs either 1 gram or 2 grams. Now they want to divide all candies among themselves fairly so that the total weight of Alice's candies is equal to the total weight of Bob's candies.\nCheck if they can do that.\nNote that candies are not allowed to be cut in half.",
    "input_specification": "The first line contains one integer\nt\n(\n1≤t≤104\n) — the number of test cases. Then\nt\ntest cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer\nn\n(\n1≤n≤100\n) — the number of candies that Alice and Bob received.\nThe next line contains\nn\nintegers\na1,a2,…,an\n — the weights of the candies. The weight of each candy is either\n1\nor\n2\n.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of\nn\nover all test cases does not exceed\n105\n.",
    "output_specification": "For each test case, output on a separate line:\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).",
