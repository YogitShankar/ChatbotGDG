    "description": "You are given an array\na\nconsisting of\nn\n(\nn≥3\n) positive integers. It is known that in this array, all the numbers except one are the same (for example, in the array\n[4,11,4,4]\nall numbers except one are equal to\n4\n).\nPrint the index of the element that does not equal others. The numbers in the array are numbered from one.",
    "input_specification": "The first line contains a single integer\nt\n(\n1≤t≤100\n). Then\nt\ntest cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer\nn\n(\n3≤n≤100\n) — the length of the array\na\n.\nThe second line of each test case contains\nn\nintegers\na1,a2,…,an\n(\n1≤ai≤100\n).\nIt is guaranteed that all the numbers except one in the\na\narray are the same.",
