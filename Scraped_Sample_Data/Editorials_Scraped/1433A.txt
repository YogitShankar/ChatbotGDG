1433A - Boring ApartmentsIdea: vovuh Tutorial1433A - Boring ApartmentsThis problem has a lot of solutions. You could even hard code all possible tests to solve it. But this problem has 𝑂(1) solution. Let the digit of 𝑥 be 𝑑𝑖𝑔. Then our character pressed each digit before 𝑑𝑖𝑔 exactly 10 times (1+2+3+4). And the amount of times he pressed the digit 𝑑𝑖𝑔 depends on the length of 𝑥. Let 𝑙𝑒𝑛 be the length of 𝑥, then the amount of times he pressed the digit 𝑑𝑖𝑔 is 1+2+…+𝑙𝑒𝑛=𝑙𝑒𝑛(𝑙𝑒𝑛+1)2. So the final answer is 10⋅(𝑑𝑖𝑔−1)+𝑙𝑒𝑛(𝑙𝑒𝑛+1)2. Solution#include <bits/stdc++.h>
