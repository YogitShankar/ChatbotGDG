1619A - Square String?Idea: MikeMirzayanov Tutorial1619A - Square String?If the length of the given string 𝑠 is odd, then the answer is NO, since adding two strings cannot do that. Otherwise, let 𝑛 be the length of the string. Let's go through the first half of the string, comparing whether its first and 𝑛2+1 characters are equal, its second and 𝑛2+2 characters are equal, and so on. If the characters in any pair are not equal, the answer is NO, otherwise - YES. Solution#include <bits/stdc++.h>
 
using namespace std;
 
#define forn(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < int(n); i++)
 
int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    forn(tt, t) {
        string s;
        cin >> s;
        bool ok = true;
        if (s.length() % 2 == 0) {
            forn(i, s.length() / 2)
                if (s[i] != s[i + s.length() / 2])
                    ok = false;
        } else
            ok = false;
        cout << (ok ? "YES" : "NO") << endl;
    }
