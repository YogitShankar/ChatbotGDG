1370A - Maximum GCD Tutorial1370A - Maximum GCDKey Idea:Answer for any 𝑛≥2 is equal to ⌊𝑛2⌋ .Solution:Let the maximum gcd be equal to 𝑔. Since the two numbers in a pair are distinct, one of them must be >𝑔 and both of them must be divisible by 𝑔. The smallest multiple of 𝑔, greater than 𝑔, is 2⋅𝑔. Since each number in the pair must be <=𝑛, we must have 2⋅𝑔<=𝑛, or 𝑔<=⌊𝑛2⌋. We can achieve 𝑔=⌊𝑛2⌋, by choosing ⌊𝑛2⌋ and 2⋅⌊𝑛2⌋.Time Complexity: 𝑂(1) Code
#include < bits/stdc++.h >
using namespace std;
 
#define IOS ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
#define endl "\n"
#define int long long

const int N = 1e5 + 5;

int32_t main()
{
	IOS;
	int t;
	cin >> t;
	while(t--)
	{
		int n;
		cin >> n;
		cout << n / 2 << endl;
	}
	return 0;
