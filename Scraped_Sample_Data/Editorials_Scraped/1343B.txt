1343B - Balanced ArrayIdea: vovuh Tutorial1343B - Balanced ArrayFirstly, if 𝑛 is not divisible by 4 then the answer is "NO" because the parities of halves won't match. Otherwise, the answer is always "YES". Let's construct it as follows: firstly, let's create the array [2,4,6,…,𝑛,1,3,5,…,𝑛−1]. This array is almost good except one thing: the sum in the right half is exactly 𝑛2 less than the sum in the left half. So we can fix it easily: just add 𝑛2 to the last element. Solution#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
#ifdef _DEBUG
	freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
//	freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
	
	int t;
	cin >> t;
	while (t--) {
		int n;
		cin >> n;
		n /= 2;
		if (n & 1) {
			cout << "NO" << endl;
			continue;
		}
		cout << "YES" << endl;
		for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
			cout << i * 2 << " ";
		}
		for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
			cout << i * 2 - 1 << " ";
		}
		cout << 3 * n - 1 << endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
