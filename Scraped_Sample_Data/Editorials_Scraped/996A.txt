996A - Hit the LotteryThe problem is to minimize 洧논1+洧논2+洧논3+洧논4+洧논5 given that 洧논1+5洧논2+10洧논3+20洧논4+100洧논5=洧녵. It is pretty simple to see that we can operate greedily: take as many 100 as we can, then 20, then 10, etc.The solutions works because each number in the sequence 1,5,10,20,100 is a divisor of the number after it.
