732A - Buy a ShovelIn this problem we have to find the minimal possible value of x such that k·x mod 10 = 0 or k·x mod 10 = r. It's easy to see that this x always exists and it is not greater than 10 (because k·10 mod 10 = 0). Let's iterate on x, and if its current value satisfies any of the requirements, we print the answer. Time complexity: O(const), where const = 10.
