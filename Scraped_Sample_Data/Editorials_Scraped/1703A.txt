1703A - YES or YES?Idea: flamestorm Tutorial1703A - YES or YES?You should implement what is written in the statement. Here are three ways to do it:   Check that the first character is 𝚈 or 𝚢, check that the second character is 𝙴 or 𝚎, and check the third character is 𝚂 or 𝚜.  Make an array storing all acceptable strings (there are only 8), and loop and see if any of the strings match the input.  Use some built-in function like tolower() in C++ to make the string all lowercase, and check if 𝑠 is equal to 𝚢𝚎𝚜.  The complexity is (1) per test case. Solution#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

const int MAX = 200007;
const int MOD = 1000000007;

void solve() {
	string s;
	cin >> s;
	if (s[0] != 'y' && s[0] != 'Y') {cout << "NO\n";}
	else if (s[1] != 'e' && s[1] != 'E') {cout << "NO\n";}
	else if (s[2] != 's' && s[2] != 'S') {cout << "NO\n";}
	else {cout << "YES\n";}
}

int main() {
	ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(nullptr);
	int tt; cin >> tt; for (int i = 1; i <= tt; i++) {solve();}
	// solve();
}
