1367A - Short SubstringsAuthor: MikeMirzayanov Editorial1367A - Short SubstringsNote that the first two characters of 𝑎 match the first two characters of 𝑏. The third character of the string 𝑏 again matches the second character of 𝑎 (since it is the first character in the second substring, which contains the second and the third character of 𝑎). The fourth character 𝑏 matches with the third character of 𝑎.It is easy to notice that such a pattern continues further. That is, the string 𝑎 consists of the first character 𝑏 and all characters at even positions in 𝑏. Solution#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
	cin >> t;

	for (int test = 1; test <= t; test++) {
		string b;
		cin >> b;

		string a = b.substr(0, 2);

		for (int i = 3; i < b.size(); i += 2) {
			a += b[i];
		}

		cout << a << endl;
	}

	return 0;
