Problem: 1343B - Balanced Array
Link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1343/B

Description:
You are given a positive integer
n
, it is guaranteed that
n
is even (i.e. divisible by
2
).
You want to construct the array
a
of length
n
such that:
If there are multiple answers, you can print any. It is not guaranteed that the answer exists.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.

Input Specification:
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1<=t<=104
) - the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The only line of the test case contains one integer
n
(
2<=n<=2⋅105
) - the length of the array. It is guaranteed that that
n
is even (i.e. divisible by
2
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
(
∑n<=2⋅105
).

Output Specification:
For each test case, print the answer - "NO" (without quotes), if there is no suitable answer for the given test case or "YES" in the first line and any suitable array
a1,a2,…,an
(
1<=ai<=109
) satisfying conditions from the problem statement on the second line.
