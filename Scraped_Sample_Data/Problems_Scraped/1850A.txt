Description:
Suneet has three digits
a
,
b
, and
c
.
Since math isn't his strongest point, he asks you to determine if you can choose any two digits to make a sum greater or equal to
10
.
Output "YES" if there is such a pair, and "NO" otherwise.

Input Specification:
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1<=t<=1000
) - the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains three digits
a
,
b
,
c
(
0<=a,b,c<=9
).

Output Specification:
For each test case, output "YES" if such a pair exists, and "NO" otherwise.
You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).
