Problem: 1624A - Plus One on the Subset
Link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1624/A

Description:
Polycarp got an array of integers
a[1…n]
as a gift. Now he wants to perform a certain number of operations (possibly zero) so that all elements of the array become the same (that is, to become
a1=a2=⋯=an
).
For example, let
a=[4,2,1,6,2]
. He can perform the following operation: select indices 1, 2, and 4 and increase elements of the array in those indices by
1
. As a result, in one operation, he can get a new state of the array
a=[5,3,1,7,2]
.
What is the minimum number of operations it can take so that all elements of the array become equal to each other (that is, to become
a1=a2=⋯=an
)?

Input Specification:
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1<=t<=104
)  - the number of test cases in the test.
The following are descriptions of the input test cases.
The first line of the description of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1<=n<=50
)  - the array
a
.
The second line of the description of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1<=ai<=109
)  - elements of the array
a
.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print one integer  - the minimum number of operations to make all elements of the array
a
equal.
