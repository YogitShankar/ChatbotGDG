Link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1335/A

Description:
There are two sisters Alice and Betty. You have
n
candies. You want to distribute these
n
candies between two sisters in such a way that:
Your task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute exactly
n
candies between sisters in a way described above. Candies are indistinguishable.
Formally, find the number of ways to represent
n
as the sum of
n=a+b
, where
a
and
b
are positive integers and
a>b
.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.

Input Specification:
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1<=t<=104
) - the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The only line of a test case contains one integer
n
(
1<=n<=2â‹…109
) - the number of candies you have.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print the answer - the number of ways to distribute exactly
n
candies between two sisters in a way described in the problem statement. If there is no way to satisfy all the conditions, print
0
.
