Problem: 1328A - Divisibility Problem
Link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1328/A

Description:
You are given two positive integers
a
and
b
. In one move you can increase
a
by
1
(replace
a
with
a+1
). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make
a
divisible by
b
. It is possible, that you have to make
0
moves, as
a
is already divisible by
b
. You have to answer
t
independent test cases.

Input Specification:
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1<=t<=104
) - the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The only line of the test case contains two integers
a
and
b
(
1<=a,b<=109
).

Output Specification:
For each test case print the answer - the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make
a
divisible by
b
.
