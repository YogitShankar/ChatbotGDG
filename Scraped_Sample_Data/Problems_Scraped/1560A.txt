Problem: 1560A - Dislike of Threes
Link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1560/A

Description:
Polycarp doesn't like integers that are divisible by
3
or end with the digit
3
in their decimal representation. Integers that meet both conditions are disliked by Polycarp, too.
Polycarp starts to write out the positive (greater than
0
) integers which he likes:
1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,14,16,â€¦
. Output the
k
-th element of this sequence (the elements are numbered from
1
).

Input Specification:
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1<=t<=100
) - the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
Each test case consists of one line containing one integer
k
(
1<=k<=1000
).

Output Specification:
For each test case, output in a separate line one integer
x
- the
k
-th element of the sequence that was written out by Polycarp.
