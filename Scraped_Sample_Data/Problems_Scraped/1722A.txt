Description:
Timur likes his name. As a spelling of his name, he allows any permutation of the letters of the name. For example, the following strings are valid spellings of his name: Timur, miurT, Trumi, mriTu. Note that the correct spelling must have uppercased T and lowercased other letters.
Today he wrote string
s

n
consisting only of uppercase or lowercase Latin letters. He asks you to check if
s
is the correct spelling of his name.

t
(
1<=t<=103
) - the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(1<=n<=10)
 - the length of string
s
.
The second line of each test case contains a string
s
consisting of only uppercase or lowercase Latin characters.

Output Specification:
For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if
s

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).
