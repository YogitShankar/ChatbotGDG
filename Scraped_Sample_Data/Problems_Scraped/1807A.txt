Description:
You are given three integers
a
,
b
, and
c
such that exactly one of these two equations is true:

Input Specification:
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1<=t<=162
) - the number of test cases.
The description of each test case consists of three integers
a
,
b
,
c
(
1<=a,b<=9
,
âˆ’8<=c<=18
). The additional constraint on the input: it will be generated so that exactly one of the two equations will be true.

Output Specification:
For each test case, output either + or - on a new line, representing the correct equation.
