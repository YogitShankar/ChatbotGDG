Problem: 1154A - Restoring Three Numbers
Link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1154/A

Description:
Polycarp has guessed three positive integers
洧녩
,
洧녪
and
洧녫
. He keeps these numbers in secret, but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order - their pairwise sums (three numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number). So, there are four numbers on a board in random order:
洧녩+洧녪
,
洧녩+洧녫
,
洧녪+洧녫
and
洧녩+洧녪+洧녫
.
You have to guess three numbers
洧녩
,
洧녪
and
洧녫
using given numbers. Print three guessed integers in any order.
Pay attention that some given numbers
洧녩
,
洧녪
and
洧녫
can be equal (it is also possible that
洧녩=洧녪=洧녫
).

Input Specification:
The only line of the input contains four positive integers
洧논
1
,
洧논
2
,
洧논
3
,
洧논
4
(
2<=
洧논
洧녰
<=
10
9
) - numbers written on a board in random order. It is guaranteed that the answer exists for the given number
洧논
1
,
洧논
2
,
洧논
3
,
洧논
4
.

Output Specification:
Print such positive integers
洧녩
,
洧녪
and
洧녫
that four numbers written on a board are values
洧녩+洧녪
,
洧녩+洧녫
,
洧녪+洧녫
and
洧녩+洧녪+洧녫
written in some order. Print
洧녩
,
洧녪
and
洧녫
in any order. If there are several answers, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.
