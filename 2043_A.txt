A. Coin Transformation time limit per test2 seconds time limit per test memory limit per test512 megabytes memory limit per test inputstandard input input outputstandard output output Initially, you have a coin with value n. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):transform one coin with value x, where x isgreater than 3(x>3), into two coins with value \lfloor \frac{x}{4} \rfloor.What is the maximum number of coins you can have after performing this operation any number of times? Initially, you have a coin with value n. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): What is the maximum number of coins you can have after performing this operation any number of times? InputThe first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^{18}). Input The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^{18}). OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of coins you can have after performing the operation any number of times. Output For each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of coins you can have after performing the operation any number of times. ExampleInput415161000000000000000000Output1

NoteIn the first example, you have a coin of value 1, and you can't do anything with it. So, the answer is 1.In the second example, you can transform a coin of value 5 into two coins with value 1.In the third example, you can transform a coin of value 16 into two coins with value 4. Each of the resulting coins can be transformed into two coins with value 1. Note In the first example, you have a coin of value 1, and you can't do anything with it. So, the answer is 1.
