Title: C. Palindromic Subsequences
Statement:

For an integer sequence
a=[a1,a2,…,an]
, we define
f(a)
as the length of the longest subsequence
∗
of
a
that is a palindrome
†
.
Let
g(a)
represent the number of subsequences of length
f(a)
that are palindromes. In other words,
g(a)
counts the number of palindromic subsequences in
a
that have the maximum length.
Given an integer
n
, your task is to find any sequence
a
of
n
integers that satisfies the following conditions:
It can be proven that such a sequence always exists under the given constraints.
∗
A sequence
x
is a subsequence of a sequence
y
if
x
can be obtained from
y
by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.
†
A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same from left to right as from right to left. For example,
[1,2,1,3,1,2,1]
,
[5,5,5,5]
, and
[4,3,3,4]
are palindromes, while
[1,2]
and
[2,3,3,3,3]
are not.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤100
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
6≤n≤100
) — the length of the sequence.
Note that there are no constraints on the sum of
n
over all test cases.
For each test case, output
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
, representing an array that satisfies the conditions.
If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.
In the first example, one possible solution is
a=[1,1,2,3,1,2]
. In this case,
f(a)=3
as the longest palindromic subsequence has length
3
. There are
7
ways to choose a subsequence of length
3
that is a palindrome, as shown below:
Therefore,
g(a)=7
, which is greater than
n=6
. Hence,
a=[1,1,2,3,1,2]
is a valid solution.
In the second example, one possible solution is
a=[7,3,3,7,5,3,7,7,3]
. In this case,
f(a)=5
. There are
24
ways to choose a subsequence of length
5
that is a palindrome. Some examples are
[
a
2
,
a
4
,
a
5
,
a
8
,
a
9
]=[3,7,5,7,3]
and
[
a
1
,
a
4
,
a
6
,
a
7
,
a
8
]=[7,7,3,7,7]
. Therefore,
g(a)=24
, which is greater than
n=9
. Hence,
a=[7,3,3,7,5,3,7,7,3]
is a valid solution.
In the third example,
f(a)=7
and
g(a)=190
, which is greater than
n=15
.
