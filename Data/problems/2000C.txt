Description:
Kristina has an array a, called a template, consisting of n integers. She also has m strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The strings are numbered from 1 to m. She wants to check which strings match the template.
A string s is considered to match the template if all of the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied: 
For example, if a = [3,5,2,1,3], then the string "abfda" matches the template, while the string "afbfa" does not, since the character "f" corresponds to both numbers 1 and 5.
The first line of input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
The following descriptions are for the test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of elements in the array a.
The second line of each test case contains exactly n integers ai (−109≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array a.
The third line of each test case contains a single integer m (1≤m≤2⋅105) — the number of strings to check for template matching.
Following are m strings, each containing a non-empty string sj (1≤|sj|≤2⋅105), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105, and that the sum of the lengths of all strings does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, output m lines. On the i-th line (1≤i≤m) output: 
You may output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).
The first test case is explained in the problem statement.
