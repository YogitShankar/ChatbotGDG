Description:
This is the easy version of the problem. In this version, you only need to find the answer once. In this version, hacks are not allowed.
In a computer game, you are fighting against n monsters. Monster number i has ai health points, all ai are integers. A monster is alive while it has at least 1 health point.
You can cast spells of two types:
Dealing 1 damage to a monster reduces its health by 1.
Spells of type 1 can be cast any number of times, while a spell of type 2 can be cast at most once during the game.
What is the smallest number of times you need to cast spells of type 1 to kill all monsters?
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of monsters.
The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n) — monsters' health points.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, print a single integer — the smallest number of times you need to cast spells of type 1 to kill all monsters.
In the first test case, the initial health points of the monsters are [3,1,2]. It is enough to cast a spell of type 2: 
Since it is possible to use no spells of type 1 at all, the answer is 0.
In the second test case, the initial health points of the monsters are [4,1,5,4,1,1]. Here is one of the optimal action sequences: 
Spells of type 1 are cast 4 times in total. It can be shown that this is the smallest possible number.
