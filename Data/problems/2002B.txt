Description:
Alice got a permutation a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an of [1,2,…,n], and Bob got another permutation b1,b2,…,bn of [1,2,…,n]. They are going to play a game with these arrays.
In each turn, the following events happen in order:
The game continues for n−1 turns, after which both arrays will have exactly one remaining element: x in the array a and y in the array b.
If x=y, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. Find which player will win if both players play optimally.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows. 
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤3⋅105).
The next line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n, all ai are distinct) — the permutation of Alice.
The next line contains n integers b1,b2,…,bn (1≤bi≤n, all bi are distinct) — the permutation of Bob.
It is guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 3⋅105.
For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print Alice; otherwise, print Bob.
In the first test case, Bob can win the game by deleting the same element as Alice did.
In the second test case, Alice can delete 3 in the first turn, and then in the second turn, delete the element that is different from the one Bob deleted in the first turn to win the game.
