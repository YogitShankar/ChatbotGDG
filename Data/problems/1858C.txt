Description:
Alex got a new game called "GCD permutations" as a birthday present. Each round of this game proceeds as follows:
Alex has already played several rounds so he decided to find a permutation a1,a2,…,an such that its score is as large as possible.
Recall that gcd(x,y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of numbers x and y, and xmody denotes the remainder of dividing x by y.
†A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing a single integer n (2≤n≤105).
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.
For each test case print n distinct integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n) — the permutation with the largest possible score.
If there are several permutations with the maximum possible score, you can print any one of them.
In the first test case, Alex wants to find a permutation of integers from 1 to 5. For the permutation a=[1,2,4,3,5], the array d is equal to [1,2,1,1,1]. It contains 2 distinct integers. It can be shown that there is no permutation of length 5 with a higher score.
In the second test case, Alex wants to find a permutation of integers from 1 to 2. There are only two such permutations: a=[1,2] and a=[2,1]. In both cases, the array d is equal to [1,1], so both permutations are correct.
In the third test case, Alex wants to find a permutation of integers from 1 to 7. For the permutation a=[1,2,3,6,4,5,7], the array d is equal to [1,1,3,2,1,1,1]. It contains 3 distinct integers so its score is equal to 3. It can be shown that there is no permutation of integers from 1 to 7 with a score higher than 3.
