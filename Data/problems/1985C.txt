Description:
Alex thinks some array is good if there exists some element that can be represented as the sum of all other elements (the sum of all other elements is 00 if there are no other elements). For example, the array [1,6,3,2] is good since 1+3+2=6. Furthermore, the array [0] is also good. However, the arrays [1,2,3,4] and [1] are not good.
Alex has an array a1,a2,…,an. Help him count the number of good non-empty prefixes of the array a. In other words, count the number of integers i (1≤i≤n) such that the length i prefix (i.e. a1,a2,…,ai) is good.
The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of elements in the array.
The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105. 
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of good non-empty prefixes of the array a.
In the fourth test case, the array has five prefixes: 
As you can see, three of them are good, so the answer is 3.
