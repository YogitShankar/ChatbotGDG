Description:
You are given a positive integer n.
In this problem, the MEX of a collection of integers c1,c2,…,ck is defined as the smallest positive integer x which does not occur in the collection c. 
The primality of an array a1,…,an is defined as the number of pairs (l,r) such that 1≤l≤r≤n and MEX(al,…,ar) is a prime number. 
Find any permutation of 1,2,…,n with the maximum possible primality among all permutations of 1,2,…,n. 
Note: 
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105).
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, output n integers: a permutation of 1,2,…,n that achieves the maximum possible primality.
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
In the first test case, there are 3 pairs (l,r) with 1≤l≤r≤2, out of which 2 have a prime MEX(al,…,ar): 
In the second test case, MEX(1)=2 is prime, so the primality is 1.
In the third test case, the maximum possible primality is 8.
