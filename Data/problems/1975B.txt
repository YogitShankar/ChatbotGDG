Description:
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, 378QAQ gave her an array a consisting of n positive integers as a gift.
Mocha thinks that a is beautiful if there exist two numbers i and j (1≤i,j≤n, i≠j) such that for all k (1≤k≤n), ak is divisible† by either ai or aj.
Determine whether a is beautiful.
† x is divisible by y if there exists an integer z such that x=y⋅z.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤500). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3≤n≤105) — the length of the array a.
The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array a.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.
For each test case, output "Yes" if array a is beautiful, and output "No" otherwise.
You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).
In the first test case, any two numbers in the array are coprime, so the answer is "No".
In the second test case, we can pick i=2 and j=1. Since every number in the array is divisible by ai=1, the answer is "Yes".
In the third test case, we can pick i=3 and j=5. 2 and 4 is divisible by ai=2 while 3, 6 and 12 is divisible by aj=3, so the answer is "Yes".
