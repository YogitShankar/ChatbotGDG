Editorial for Problem: C. Minimum Extraction
Problem ID: 1607C

Solution:
Short informationSorry for another delayed editorial, I know I promised that it will come out sooner the previous time, but I wasn't feeling well today, so the work was slower than usual.About problem F:I am once again sorry for the inconveniences caused by tight ML in this problem. It was not the intended behavior since we relied too much on the main solution and didn't assume most of the solutions using DFS will fail. In this editorial I attach the code of the main solution that we expected from the beginning, it uses ~75MB of memory.I guess, Div. 3 Rounds are not only for participants to learn but also can serve as educational for authors as well. I'll try not to repeat the same mistakes the next time :) Thanks to everyone for participating and hope to see you again!The editorial1607A - Linear KeyboardIdea: doreshnikov, MikeMirzayanov Tutorial1607A - Linear KeyboardSince it does not take time to place your hand over the first letter, you need to calculate the sum of the distances between the keyboard keys corresponding to each pair of adjacent letters of the word, that is n∑i=2|pos(si)−pos(si−1)| where pos(c) is the position of the keyboard key corresponding to the letter c.In order to calculate this sum, let's just iterate through the word s with the for loop and find the differences between the positions of si and si−1 on the keyboard. To find the position of a character on the keyboard, you could either use the built-in strings functions (such as str.index in Python or string::find in C++) or precalculate each letter's position on the keyboard into a separate array using another loop over a keyboard.

In general, making jumps with numbers $$$4k + 1 \ldots 4k + 4$$$, the grasshopper will start from coordinate $$$0$$$ and move as $$$$$$0 \underset{\ ^{-(4k+1)}}{\longrightarrow} -(4k + 1) \underset{\ ^{+(4k+2)}}{\longrightarrow} 1 \underset{\ ^{+(4k+3)}}{\longrightarrow} 4k + 4 \underset{\ ^{-(4k+4)}}{\longrightarrow} 0$$$$$$Thus, if $$$x_0$$$ were always zero, the answer would be   $$$-n$$$ if $$$n \equiv 1 \bmod 4$$$  $$$1$$$ if $$$n \equiv 2 \bmod 4$$$  $$$n + 1$$$ if $$$n \equiv 3 \bmod 4$$$  $$$0$$$ if $$$n$$$ is divisible by $$$4$$$ Let's find an answer for the cases when $$$x_0 \neq 0$$$. But if $$$x_0$$$ is even, then all steps will follow the same directions, and the answer will be $$$x_0 + D$$$, where $$$D$$$ is the answer for the same $$$n$$$ and starting point $$$0$$$ (described above). And if $$$x_0$$$ is odd, then all steps will have opposite directions, and the answer will be $$$x_0 - D$$$. Solutiont = int(input())

If you swap two elements in the original array, the set of elements at each step will not change in any way. Let's sort the original array $$$a$$$ and denote it by $$$a^0$$$.We denote by $$$a^i$$$ the state of array $$$a^0$$$ after applying $$$i$$$ operations of minimum extraction. The minimum element in $$$a^0$$$ is $$$a^0_1$$$, so the elements of array $$$a^1$$$ will be equal to $$$a^1_i = a^0_{i+1} - a^0_1$$$, and therefore the minimum of them will be $$$a^0_2 - a^0_1$$$.Constructing an array $$$a^2$$$, we can notice that its elements are equal to $$$a^2_i = a^1_{i+1} - a^1_1$$$. We know that the elements of $$$a^1$$$ are the difference between corresponding elements of the array $$$a^0$$$ and $$$a^0_1$$$, so $$$$$$a^2_i = a^1_{i+1} - a^1_1 = (a^0_{i+2} - a^0_1) - (a^0_2 - a^0_1) = a^0_{i+2} - a^0_2$$$$$$Thus, the elements of the array $$$a^2$$$ are the differences between elements of $$$a^0$$$ starting with third and $$$a^0_2$$$, the minimum of which is $$$a^0_3 - a^0_2$$$. It is not difficult to show in a similar way (for example by induction) that the elements of $$$a^c$$$ are equal to $$$a^c_i = a^0_{i+c} - a^0_c$$$, the minimum of which is $$$a^0_{c+1} - a^0_c$$$.So the "candidates" for the answer are simply differences of adjacent elements of the array $$$a^0$$$. Indeed, if we look at $$$a^0 = [1, 4, 6, 12, 13]$$$, it will undergo changes as follows: $$$[\color{blue}{1}, 4, 6, 12, 15] \to [\color{blue}{3}, 5, 11, 14] \to [\color{blue}{2}, 8, 11] \to [\color{blue}{6}, 9] \to [\color{blue}{3}]$$$. You can notice that the minimum elements starting with after the first operation are exactly $$$4 - 1$$$, $$$6 - 4$$$, $$$12 - 6$$$ and $$$15 - 12$$$, respectively.Thus, to solve the problem, it was sufficient to sort the array in ascending order, then take the maximum of the original first element and the differences of all adjacent elements $$$$$$\max\left(a^0_1, \max\limits_{i=2}^n \left(a^0_i - a^0_{i-1}\right) \right)$$$$$$ Solutiont = int(input())

Thus, if a permutation can be obtained at all, some permutation can be obtained by making all the red numbers equal to $$$n, n - 1, \ldots, n - k + 1$$$, and the blue ones equal to $$$1, 2, \ldots, n - k$$$, where $$$k$$$ is the total count of red numbers.Now consider separately two red numbers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ such that $$$a_i > a_j$$$. If $$$x$$$ is produced by increasing $$$a_i$$$ and $$$y$$$ is produced by increasing $$$a_j$$$, and in the same time $$$x < y$$$ then $$$y > x \geqslant a_i > a_j$$$, and the following is also true: $$$x > a_j$$$ and $$$y > a_i$$$. So we just showed that if an answer exists, it also exists if greater numbers are produced by greater values from the input. The same holds for the blue numbers.Let us sort all elements $$$a_i$$$ by the key $$$(c_i, a_i)$$$, where $$$c_i$$$ the color of $$$i$$$-th element (and blue comes before red). It remains to check that for any $$$t$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ we can get the number $$$t$$$ from the $$$t$$$-th element of the obtained sorted array. To do this, we iterate through it and check that either $$$c_t = \,$$$'B' and $$$a_t \geqslant t$$$ so it can be reduced to $$$t$$$, or, symmetrically, $$$c_t = \,$$$'R' and $$$a_t \leqslant t$$$.

}1607E - Robot on the Board 1Idea: MikeMirzayanov Tutorial1607E - Robot on the Board 1Let's look at the answer $$$(r, c)$$$. Let's see how many commands the robot can execute. Since the robot breaks as soon as goes outside the field, if any command causes it to break, it either leads to its total shift relative to $$$(r, c)$$$ of exactly $$$c$$$ to the left or exactly $$$m - c + 1$$$ to the right, or, similarly, of exactly $$$r$$$ up or exactly $$$n - r + 1$$$ down.Denote by $$$d[\leftrightarrow]$$$ and $$$d[\updownarrow]$$$ the sum of the maximum positive (right, down) and maximum negative (left, up) shifts in the corresponding direction. By adding up the above constraints, we get the fact that the robot will not fall off the board only if $$$d[\leftrightarrow] \leqslant (c - 1) + ((m - c + 1) - 1) = m - 1$$$ and $$$d[\updownarrow] \leqslant (r - 1) + ((n - r + 1) - 1) = n - 1$$$.Note that the reverse is also true: if both these conditions are satisfied, then starting from the point $$$(\max[\leftarrow] + 1, \max[\uparrow] + 1)$$$ where $$$\max[\mathtt{dir}]$$$ is the maximum shift along the direction $$$\mathtt{dir}$$$, the robot will not pass any of the board's edges. Thus, it is sufficient to find the number of commands which, when executed, hold the following invariant: $$$$$$d[\leftrightarrow] \leqslant m - 1 \land d[\updownarrow] \leqslant n - 1$$$$$$The horizontal shift can be calculated as the difference between the number of letters 'R' and the number of letters 'L' encountered. Similarly, the vertical shift — as the difference of the numbers of 'D' and 'U'. Let's iterate over the sequence of commands, maintaining relevant values of $$$\max[\mathtt{dir}]$$$ for all $$$\mathtt{dir} \in [\leftarrow, \rightarrow, \uparrow, \downarrow]$$$. After executing each command, if the robot goes farther in some direction than ever before, we update the corresponding $$$\max$$$.Either we reach the end of $$$s$$$, or we meet a command after which either $$$d[\leftrightarrow] = \max[\leftarrow] + \max[\rightarrow]$$$ becomes equal to $$$m$$$, or $$$d[\updownarrow] = \max[\uparrow] + \max[\downarrow]$$$ becomes equal to $$$n$$$ and the robot breaks, so the previous command was the last one successfully executed. The possible answer is $$$(\max[\leftarrow] + 1, \max[\uparrow] + 1)$$$, where the $$$\max$$$ values are calculated one command before the robot broke. Solution#include <bits/stdc++.h>

}1607F - Robot on the Board 2Idea: doreshnikov Tutorial1607F - Robot on the Board 2Let's start moving from an arbitrary cell of the table, for example, from $$$(1, 1)$$$. Movement from each cell is specified by the direction given in that cell, so you can run a loop with a stopping condition "exit from the board border or get to the already visited cell". Create a separate array $$$d[r][c]$$$ — how many commands the robot will execute, starting the movement from the cell $$$(r, c)$$$; we will also use it to check whether the cell has already been visited or not (not visited if $$$d[r][c]$$$ is not yet positive).Finishing the movement from $$$(1, 1)$$$ let's consider two cases.   Either we have gone beyond the boundary of the array, then we can say for sure that for the $$$i$$$-th cell from the end of the sequence $$$(r_i, c_i)$$$ the answer is $$$d[r_i][c_i] = i$$$.  Or we came to the already visited cell, let it be the $$$t$$$-th from the end in our path. Then at the end of the path, there is a cycle of length $$$t$$$: starting the movement at any cell of this cycle, the robot will walk exactly $$$t$$$ steps until it arrives at the already visited cell. Thus, for $$$i \leqslant t$$$ distance will be equal to $$$d[r_i][c_i] = t$$$, and for all others it will be, as in the first case, $$$d[r_i][c_i] = i$$$. Let us run the same algorithm from the next cell, which we have not yet considered. There will be three cases of robot stopping the execution of the commands: the first two repeat those already considered above, and the third case is that the robot will come to the cell $$$(r_0, c_0)$$$ already visited on some of the previous iterations of our algorithm. In this case we know that starting from $$$(r_0, c_0)$$$, the robot will make exactly $$$d[r_0][c_0]$$$ steps, so for the $$$i$$$-th cell from the end on the current path $$$d[r_i][c_i] = d[r_0][c_0] + i$$$ will hold. The first two cases are handled completely in the same way as described above. Each of the cases is eventually reduced to another iteration over the cells visited in the current path. Let's visit all the cells in reverse and mark all values of $$$d$$$.Such algorithm is enough to repeat until each cell is processed, after which for each cell of the table its $$$d$$$ will be known and we'll only have to choose the maximal value of $$$d[r][c]$$$ among all $$$(r, c)$$$.

}1607G - Banquet Preparations 1Idea: doreshnikov Tutorial1607G - Banquet Preparations 1Let's find how much meat and fish a taster can eat at most. Note that a taster can eat no more than $$$\min(a_i, m)$$$ of fish from the $$$i$$$-th dish (since he can't eat more than $$$m$$$ or more than there is at all). Similarly, he can eat no more than $$$\min(b_i, m)$$$ of meat. Let's sum the obtained values over all $$$i$$$ and denote the resulting sums by $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ —the maximum total amount of fish and meat that can be eaten.Let's denote by balance* $$$T$$$ the value $$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n a_i - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n b_i$$$, that is the balance without module. If the taster eats as much fish as possible, he will eat $$$A$$$ of fish and $$$nm - A$$$ of meat, and change the balance* by $$$-A + (nm - A) = nm - 2A$$$. Similarly, if he eats the maximum amount of meat, the balance* will change by $$$2B - nm$$$. Note that the taster can achieve any balance* between $$$2B - nm$$$ and $$$nm - 2A$$$ of the same oddity as both of these numbers. To do this, just take the way of eating the maximum fish and substitute eating a gram of fish for a gram of meat several times.Thus, the final balance $$$T_\mathtt{res}$$$ can be found as $$$\min |x|$$$ over all $$$x$$$ between $$$T + (2B - nm)$$$ and $$$T + (nm - 2A)$$$ with same oddity. To do this, just check the boundaries of the resulting segment — if they have the same sign, then it's the boundary with the smallest absolute value, otherwise we can take one of the numbers $$$-1$$$, $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$ present in said set (depending on the parity of $$$nm$$$).All that remains is to find how much of what type to eat from each dish. Having obtained the answer in the previous paragraph (the final balance), we can reconstruct how much fish and how much meat the taster has to eat to achieve it. The expected amount of fish to be eaten can be found as $$$e_A = \frac{T + nm - T_\mathtt{res}}{2}$$$. Note that the taster must eat $$$\max(m - b_i, 0)$$$ of fish from the $$$i$$$-th dish, since if meat $$$b_i < m$$$, then at least $$$m - b_i$$$ of fish is guaranteed to be eaten. Let's break down $$$e_A$$$ into the sum of $$$nm - B$$$ (how much total fish will have to be eaten anyway) and the remaining value $$$g_A = e_A - (nm - B)$$$. Let's go through all the dishes and collect the first summand as just the sum of $$$\max(m - b_i, 0)$$$ over all $$$i$$$, and the second summand with greedy algorithm, each time giving the taster as much fish beyond what he must eat anyway until the sum of such "additions" reaches $$$g_A$$$. And knowing for each dish how much fish will be eaten from it, the amount of meat eaten can be calculated by subtracting the fish eaten from $$$m$$$. Solution#include <bits/stdc++.h>

Let's calculate this value for each dish and group all the dishes with equal calculated values.The minimum amount of fish that can remain in the $$$i$$$-th dish is $$$a_i^\mathtt{min} = \max(0, a_i - m_i)$$$ in case where the maximum possible mass of fish is eaten. Similarly, the maximum amount of fish that can remain is $$$a_i^\mathtt{max} = a_i + \min(0, b_i - m_i)$$$ in case where the maximum possible mass of meat is eaten. Consider one of the groups $$$g$$$ in which there are all the dishes with equal values $$$G = a_i + b_i - m_i$$$. We sill assign each dish a corresponding segment on the coordinate line between $$$a_i^{\mathtt{min}}$$$ and $$$a_i^{\mathtt{max}}$$$. This segment specifies all possible values of the remaining mass of fish in the dish; any value on it is achievable by replacing eating some mass of fish with the same mass of meat. And since $$$G$$$ is common, the same amount of remaining fish will imply the same amount of remaining meat, thus, equality.Let us solve the problem for each group independently. Within a group, the problem is reduced to choosing as few points as possible that "cover" all the segments described in the last paragraph (that is, that there should be a point inside each segment). Each selected point will correspond to the resulting dish, and it being inside a segment will mean that such a resulting dish can be obtained from the corresponding starting one. Such a problem is solved as follows:   we choose a segment with the minimal right end; because it must contain at least one chosen point we'll greedily choose it equal to its right end;  there's no point in choosing a point to the left from it, since it will not cover more segments than the right end of the segment in question;  we'll mark all segments containing this point as covered, and repeat the algorithm for the next unprocessed segment with the minimal right end. For this algorithm, it is sufficient to sort the segments by their right ends within each group and iterate through the segments, greedily selecting points in the manner described above. The set of points obtained at the end will be the answer, and its size and the information about the point selected within each segment should be printed in the output. If for a dish $$$(a_i, b_i, m_i)$$$ a point $$$x$$$ is chosen inside its corresponding segment, then there should be exactly $$$x$$$ of fish left in it, that is, you should output the numbers $$$a_i - x$$$ and $$$m_i - (a_i - x)$$$ in the answer.

Sorry for another delayed editorial, I know I promised that it will come out sooner the previous time, but I wasn't feeling well today, so the work was slower than usual.
About problem F:
I am once again sorry for the inconveniences caused by tight ML in this problem. It was not the intended behavior since we relied too much on the main solution and didn't assume most of the solutions using DFS will fail. In this editorial I attach the code of the main solution that we expected from the beginning, it uses ~75MB of memory.
I guess, Div. 3 Rounds are not only for participants to learn but also can serve as educational for authors as well. I'll try not to repeat the same mistakes the next time :) Thanks to everyone for participating and hope to see you again!
