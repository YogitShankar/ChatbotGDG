Solution:
1765A - Access LevelsIdea: BledDest, preparation: awoo Tutorial1765A - Access LevelsSuppose two documents i and j belong to the same access group, and the access level for the document i is greater than the access level for document j. Then, every developer which has the access to the document i, has the access to the document j as well; so, for every d∈[1,n], the condition ad,i≤ad,j must hold.We can build a directed graph where the arc i→j represents that this condition holds for the (ordered) pair of documents (i,j). Every access group should be a path in this graph — so, our problem now requires us to cover a directed graph with the minimum number of vertex-disjoint paths.Let's assume that the graph is acyclic. Then every path is acyclic as well, so the number of vertices in a path is equal to the number of arcs in a path, plus one. Let k be the number of paths, v be the number of vertices, and e be the total number of arcs used in the paths. It's easy to see that k+e=v; so, by maximizing the total number of arcs in the paths, we minimize the number of paths.So, we need to choose the maximum number of arcs so that each vertex belongs to only one path among those formed by these arcs. It is equivalent to the combination of the following two conditions:  each vertex should have at most one incoming chosen arc;  each vertex should have at most one outgoing chosen arc. Now our problem can be solved with network flows or bipartite matching. For example, one of the solutions is to create a bipartite graph where each vertex of the original graph is represented by two vertices, one for each part; and an arc i→j from the original graph is converted to the edge connecting the vertex i in the left part and the vertex j in the right part. It's easy to see that every matching in this graph fulfills the aforementioned two conditions, thus giving us a correct decomposition of an acyclic directed graph into vertex-disjoint paths — so, in order to minimize the number of such paths, we need to find the maximum matching. All that's left is to actually find these paths and convert them into the access groups/levels for the documents, and set access levels for the developers, which is pretty easy and straightforward to implement.But wait, what if the graph is not acyclic? Fortunately, a cycle can exist only between two documents with identical access requirements. We can deal with these in one of two ways:  compress all identical documents into one vertex;  or use the document index as the tiebreak if two documents are completely identical otherwise. Even the most basic implementation of bipartite matching with Kuhn's algorithm will yield a solution in O(m3+m2n). Solution (awoo)#include <bits/stdc++.h>

}1765B - Broken KeyboardIdea: vovuh, preparation: vovuh Tutorial1765B - Broken KeyboardThere are many ways to solve this problem. Basically, we need to check two conditions.The first one is the condition on the number of characters: nmod3≠2, since after the first key press, we get the remainder 1 modulo 3, after the second key press, we get the remainder 0 modulo 3, then 1 again, then 0 — and so on, and we cannot get the remainder 2.Then we need to check that, in each pair of characters which appeared from the same key press, these characters are the same — that is, s2=s3, s5=s6, s8=s9, and so on. Solution (vovuh)for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print('YES' if n % 3 != 2 and not False in [s[i * 3 + 1] == s[i * 3 + 2] for i in range(n // 3)] else 'NO')1765C - Card GuessingIdea: DStepanenko, preparation: BledDest Tutorial1765C - Card GuessingObviously, linearity of expectation, we are calculating the sum of probability to guess correctly for each position from 1 to 4n.Let's start with a minor observation which can help us in calculations. The probability for all positions from k+1 onwards is the same. The probability for each position i depends on the number of ways (and some properties of them) to pick min(i−1,k) cards prior to it. Thus, when this min evaluates to k, it's all the same. We'll calculate the first k+1 positions and then multiply the last one by 4n−k.How about we start with a naive solution? Let's pretend all cards are distinguishable from each other (which, in my opinion, is a rare case for combinatorics solutions). Then we can pick a cards of the first suit, b cards of the second suit, c cards of the third suit and d cards of the fourth suit to go prior to the position a+b+c+d. Check if the sum doesn't exceed k.The number of ways to choose these cards is C(n,a)⋅C(n,b)⋅C(n,c)⋅C(n,d)⋅(a+b+c+d)!. We should also permute the remaining cars — multiply by (4n−(a+b+c+d))!. And divide everything by (4n)! to get the probability of getting exactly that permutation. The probability to guess the suit correctly is min(a,b,c,d)4n−(a+b+c+d). Thus, we should add the product of these two probabilities to the answer.The annoying aspect of this solution is actually the min function. We'd prefer to always know that a is the smallest one. Let's try to rewrite this naive in such a way that a≤b≤c≤d.Frankly, almost nothing changes. To account for the fact that we removed the order of a,b,c and d, we want to multiply the number of ways by the number of ways to permute these amounts. That number is a multinomial that depends on the sizes of equivalence classes of the amounts. As in, if the amounts are 1,1,2,3, then it's 4!2!⋅1!⋅1!. If it's 1,1,1,3, then it's 4!3!⋅1!. All the rest stays the same. Then the probability to guess correctly is just a4n−(a+b+c+d).Great, now we can make a dp out of this naive solution. Basically, the answer depends on three things. The smallest amount, the total amount, and the counts of each amount. The first one can be accounted for during the initialization phase. The second one can be accounted for at the very end. And the third one can be accounted for during the transition :)We want to construct non-decreasing sequences of length 4 with a known sum and with a known first element. Let that dp be dp[i][j][k] — some sum of probabilities over all sequences such that the current amount is i, the sum of the sequence is j, and we placed k elements in the sequence.For the transition, we want to either increase the current value i by 1, or to place from 1 to 4−k copies of the current value. If we place it, we immediately apply the cnk and divide by the multinomial coefficient — the factorial of the number of copies. We increase i as well, so that we can't place more elements equal to i.For the initialization, we iterate over the smallest element and the count of it. This way, we can put the numerator of the probability to guess the suit along with the other things.When we collect the answers, we iterate over the sum and account for the rest of the terms in the product: factorial of the sum, permuting the remaining cards, the denominator of the guess probability and so on.The formulas might get tricky, but they all make enough sense, and hopefully nothing incorrect works on the examples, which should help you to debug.Overall complexity: O(n2).There are cubic solutions, that are also smart enough in our opinion, which is why the constraints are set like that.

}1765D - Watch the VideosIdea: BledDest, preparation: DmitryKlenov Tutorial1765D - Watch the VideosIn this solution, we assume that the sequence a1,a2,…,an is sorted (if it is not — just sort it before running the solution).Suppose we download and watch the videos in some order. The answer to the problem is n+∑ai, reduced by 1 for every pair of adjacent videos that can fit onto the hard disk together (i. e. their total size is not greater than m), because for every such pair, we can start downloading the second one while watching the first one. So, we need to order the videos in such a way that the number of such pairs is the maximum possible.Suppose we want to order them so that every pair of adjacent videos is "good". We need to pick the ordering that minimizes the maximum sum of adjacent elements. There are multiple ways to construct this ordering; one of them is [an,a1,an−1,a2,an−2,a3,…], and the maximum sum of adjacent elements will be maxni=1,2i≠nai+an+1−i.Proof that this ordering is optimal starts hereSuppose j is such value of i that ai+an+1−i is the maximum, and j<n+1−j. Let's prove that we cannot make the maximum sum of adjacent elements less than aj+an+1−j. There are at most j−1 values in a which are less than aj (let's call them Group A), and at least j values that are not less than aj (let's call them Group B). If we want each sum of adjacent elements to be less than aj+an+1−j, we want the elements of Group B to be adjacent only to the elements of the Group A. The elements of Group B have at least 2j−2 links to the neighbors (since at most two of them will have only one neighbor), the elements of Group A have at most 2(j−1) links to the neighbors, but we cannot link Group A with Group B without any outside links since it will disconnect them from all other elements of the array. So, we cannot get the maximum sum less than aj+an+1−j.Proof that this ordering is optimal ends hereOkay, now what if we cannot make all pairs of adjacent elements "good"? We can run binary search on the number of pairs that should be "bad". Let this number be k, then if we need to make at most k pairs "bad", we can check that it's possible by removing k maximum elements from a and checking that now we can make the array "good". So, in total, our solution will work in O(nlogn). Solution (DmitryKlenov)#include <iostream>

So, the answer is 1 no matter what n is.If a≤b, then it's suboptimal to exchange gold coins for silver coins and then buy the gold coins back. Monocarp should earn the minimum possible number of gold coins so that they all can be exchanged into at least n silver coins; so, the number of gold coins he needs is ⌈na⌉.One small note: you shouldn't use the functions like ceil to compute a fraction rounded up, since you may get some computation errors related to using floating-point numbers (and possibly getting precision loss). Instead, you should calculate ⌈na⌉ as ⌊n+a−1a⌊ (this works for non-negative n and positive a), and every programming language provides an integer division operator which discards the fractional part and thus doesn't use floating-point computations at all.

}1765F - Chemistry LabIdea: awoo, preparation: awoo Tutorial1765F - Chemistry LabLet's start without picking the contracts. Buy them all and at least learn to calculate the answer.Obviously, k doesn't really matter for the answer. Linearity of expectation, it will be just something multiplied by k.Imagine there's just one contract. Since we can't really mix it with anything, and the probability that the customer picks exactly that concentration is 0, the answer is 0.What about two contracts? If you draw them as points (xi,ci) on the grid, then all solutions, that can be obtained from a mix of them, are a segment. Basically, the formula is exactly the parametric equation for the segment, and that's how you could come to this conclusion. The expected cost is some integral, which is basically an area below the segment.Three contracts? As a reasonable conclusion, now it's a triangle on these points. To show that, let's fix one of these points A, opposite to some base of the triangle BC. Pick a percentage of the solution A, then draw a segment from A to that percentage of BC. If you fix the percentages of B and C (the point on the segment BC), then you can basically continuously gravitate this point towards A along the drawn segment by increasing the concentration of A and decreasing the concentrations of B and C, while keeping their proportion to each other the same. The union of all options covers the entire triangle and can never go outside it.Ok, let's make an educated guess about more contracts and try to show that. All solutions, that can be obtained with a mix of several solutions, are insides of a convex hull of the set of points. Let the set of points be convex already. If it isn't, we can say that the answer is the union of all convex subsets of it, which is equal to the convex hull. To prove it for the convex set, we can choose any three consecutive points on it and contract them into a segment, with the proof for the triangle. Continue until we reach two points.All solutions are a convex hull, but we only care about the ones with the maximum cost. That would be the set of the highest intersection points of the convex hull and the vertical lines for all concentrations. Which is known as an upper envelope of the convex hull. The expected cost is the area below that upper envelope.So we learned to calculate the answer for a fixed set of solutions. Let's learn how to pick them.We want to directly construct that upper envelope. Let me first tell you a direct but a slow solution.Do dynamic programming. Sort the solutions first in the increasing order of their concentration, second in the increasing order of their cost per litre. Now do dp[i][j] — the maximum answer if the last point in the upper envelope is j and the second last is i. To transition, iterate over the next point k in that upper envelope and check if the triple (i,j,k) is clockwise. To update the answer, add the newly added area below the segment (j,k), which is a trapezoid, multiplied by k, and subtract the cost of the contract k. That would be O(n3).Now for the funny transition. Basically, we can just not care that the points we pick give us an upper envelope. If we picked a set of points, which is not convex, then we can safely remove some points (pay less money for the contracts) and our calculated area can never decrease from that (since we still are picking points in the increasing order of x and y).Thus, we can remove the second to last point in the dp and only store the last one. That is enough to recalculate the area.Overall complexity: O(n2). Solution (awoo)#include <bits/stdc++.h>

}1765G - Guess the StringIdea: BledDest, preparation: BledDest Tutorial1765G - Guess the StringWe will design a randomized solution which spends 1.5 queries on average to guess 2 characters.First of all, let's ask p2 to learn which character is s2. Depending on whether it is 0 or 1, the details of the solution might change, but the general idea stays the same. We will assume that it is 0.We will divide the string into blocks of 2 characters and guess it block by block. Suppose a block contains the characters si−1 and si. If we want to guess it using less than 2 queries, we should start with querying the i-th position (if we start by querying the position i−1, we won't know anything about the i-th position).Suppose our query has returned a number greater than 1. Then we successfully obtained the full information about the block in one query. So, let's analyze the bad case: what if we got 0 or 1 as the result of the query?If we used prefix function, the result equal to 1 shows us that the block is 10 — 00 will give the result of at least 2, and neither 01 nor 11 can give 1 as the result. But if the result is 0, then it could mean either 01 or 11, and we need a second query to find out the exact combination.If we used antiprefix function, every character gets inverted; so, the result equal to 1 tells us that the block is 01, and the result equal to 0 tells us that the block is either 10 or 00.So, one type of query cannot distinguish 01 from 11, and the other type cannot distinguish 10 from 00. If we pick the type of query randomly, with probability of 12 we will obtain the information about the whole block in just one query; so, this method will spend 1.5 queries per block of 2 characters on average.

}1765H - Hospital QueueIdea: Neon, preparation: Neon Tutorial1765H - Hospital QueueLet's solve the problem separately for each patient.Let's assume that we are solving a problem for a patient with the number $$$s$$$. Let's iterate through the positions in the queue from the end, and the current position is $$$i$$$. Why do we try to construct the queue from the end, and not from its beginning? This allows us to handle the constraint on $$$p_i$$$ for each patient easier. If we try to form the queue starting from the beginning, we have to be very careful with these constraints on $$$p_i$$$, since placing a patient on some position might make it impossible to continue the order, but it's very difficult to understand when it concerns us. On the other hand, if we go from the end to the beginning, each patient that we can place on the current position can be placed on any of the positions we consider later as well, so our actions won't "break" the correct order; any order we build while maintaining all of the constraints for its suffix is correct. That's why this problem is easier to solve if we construct the queue backwards.Now, all we need to do is try not to place patient $$$s$$$ as long as possible. So, we can maintain all patients we can place (such a patient $$$x$$$ that $$$x$$$ is not placed yet, $$$p_x \ge i$$$ and there is no such patient $$$y$$$, that $$$x$$$ should be in the queue before $$$y$$$, but $$$y$$$ is not placed yet) now in any data structure, and when choosing who to place on each position, we delay placing patient $$$s$$$ as long as possible.

 1765I - Infinite ChessIdea: DmitryKlenov, preparation: dmitryme Tutorial1765I - Infinite ChessFirst, we can limit the field to a non-infinite amount of columns. Take the leftmost position, the rightmost one and leave like $$$10$$$ more cells from each side so that everything is nice on the borders.If the field wasn't as huge, we could just do a BFS over it. Mark the cells that are taken by the pieces and that are attacked by them. Then just go and avoid them. Unfortunately, the field is like $$$10^9$$$ cells large, and we also have up to $$$8$$$ transitions from each cell. Too much.Let's use the fact that there are not too many pieces on the board. Take a look at two pieces that have only empty columns between them. If you go far enough inwards, then all the columns between them will look the same in terms of cells to be avoided. That far enough is the columns at distance more than $$$8$$$ from both of the pieces. The only pieces that can possibly affect these columns are rooks or queens far way that fill the entire rows.Since these columns are the same, let's get rid of them and account for the distance by using a Dijkstra instead of a BFS.The solution becomes the following. Leave only the columns that have a piece at distance at most $$$8$$$ from them. There will be at most $$$16 \cdot n$$$ of them. Mark all the attacked cells on the taken columns. Do Dijkstra and carefully handle the moves over the missing columns.Let's think more about moving over the missing columns. Let the distance between adjacent taken columns be $$$d$$$. Then the king can go from some row $$$i$$$ of the first column into some row $$$j$$$ of the second column in $$$max(|i - j|, d)$$$ moves (it can save moves by going diagonally). You can code it exactly like that, but you can also do it a little neater. Leave not $$$8$$$ but $$$16$$$ columns. Now, the moves that the king saves by going diagonally will be accounted for automatically. And you can only consider going to the previous, the current or the next row for any pair of adjacent columns. Solution (awoo)#include <bits/stdc++.h>

}1765J - Hero to ZeroIdea: BledDest, preparation: BledDest Tutorial1765J - Hero to ZeroThe order of operations is interchangeable, so we assume that we perform mass operations first, and operations affecting single elements last.Suppose $$$p_i$$$ is the value we subtract from the $$$i$$$-th row using the operations affecting the whole row, and $$$q_j$$$ is the value we subtract from the $$$j$$$-th column using the operations affecting the whole column. Then the number of coins we have to pay is $$$S - (n-1) \cdot (\sum p_i + \sum q_j)$$$, since every such operation "saves" us exactly $$$n-1$$$ coins by decreasing the sum in the matrix by $$$n$$$ using only one coin.Obviously, we want to maximize $$$\sum p_i + \sum q_j$$$, but if we subtract too much, some elements of the matrix may become negative (and it will be impossible to set them to zero using single element operations). So, for every $$$i \in [1, n]$$$ and $$$j \in [1, n]$$$, the condition $$$p_i + q_j \le c_{i,j}$$$ must hold.Now let's take a look at how the Hungarian algorithm for assignment problem works. We can notice that the potentials in the Hungarian algorithm have the same constraints as the values $$$p_i$$$ and $$$q_j$$$ in our problem, and the sum of those potentials is maximized. So, if we apply the Hungarian algorithm to the matrix $$$c$$$, we can use the potentials as the values $$$p_i$$$ and $$$q_j$$$.But the matrix is too large, so what should we do? We can use the fact that the maximum possible sum of potentials is equal to the optimal solution of the assignment problem, so we should solve the assignment problem in some other way. And in this particular way of constructing the matrix $$$c$$$ (where $$$c_{i,j} = |a_i - b_j|$$$), the solution of the assignment problem is simple: we need to reorder the elements of both arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ so that the value of $$$\sum |a_i - b_i|$$$ is minimized, and it's easy to see (and to prove using exchange argument method) that sorting both arrays will give us the optimal solution.All that's left is to calculate the sum of elements in the matrix, and that can be done if for every element in $$$a$$$, we calculate the number of elements in $$$b$$$ which are less than it, the number of elements in $$$b$$$ which are greater than it, and the sum of elements of $$$b$$$ greater than it (to quickly compute the sum of $$$|a_i - b_j|$$$ for every $$$j \in [1, n]$$$). All these values can be obtained with the help of binary search, two pointers method or some data structures.The complexity of the solution is $$$O(n \log n)$$$.

}1765K - Torus PathIdea: adedalic, preparation: adedalic Tutorial1765K - Torus PathNote that you can't visit all vertices on the antidiagonal (vertices $$$(1, n), (2, n - 1), \dots (n, 1)$$$) at the same time. Let's prove it: since you are starting outside the antidiagonal then the only way to visit vertex $$$(x, n + 1 - x)$$$ is to move from $$$(x - 1, n + 1 - x)$$$ or from $$$(x, n - x)$$$. In total, there are $$$n$$$ vertices you can move from — it's vertices $$$(1, n - 1), (2, n - 2), \dots, (n - 1, 1)$$$ and $$$(n, n)$$$. But $$$(n, n)$$$ is the finishing vertices you can't leave, so there are only $$$n - 1$$$ positions left. As a result, you can visit at most $$$n - 1$$$ vertices on the antidiagonal.Now, let's prove that if you've chosen a vertex $$$(x, n + 1 - x)$$$ you decided to skip, you can always visit all other vertices. Let's use the following simple strategy: let's move right until we meet the restricted or already visited vertex, then move down once then continue moving right and so on.For example, let's visit all vertices of $$$4 \times 4$$$ matrix except vertex $$$(2, 3)$$$. The path would be the following: $$$(1, 1)$$$ $$$-$$$ $$$(1, 2)$$$ $$$-$$$ $$$(1, 3)$$$ $$$-$$$ $$$(1, 4)$$$ $$$-$$$ $$$(2, 4)$$$ $$$-$$$ $$$(2, 1)$$$ $$$-$$$ $$$(2, 2)$$$ $$$-$$$ $$$(3, 2)$$$ $$$-$$$ $$$(3, 3)$$$ $$$-$$$ $$$(3, 4)$$$ $$$-$$$ $$$(3, 1)$$$ $$$-$$$ $$$(4, 1)$$$ $$$-$$$ $$$(4, 2)$$$ $$$-$$$ $$$(4, 3)$$$ $$$-$$$ $$$(4, 4)$$$.As a result, the answer is the sum of all elements minus the minimum among $$$a[x][n + 1 - x]$$$, or $$$\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\sum_{j = 1}^{n}a[i][j] - \min_{1 \le x \le n}(a[x][n + 1 - x])$$$.

}1765L - Project ManagerIdea: BledDest, preparation: awoo Tutorial1765L - Project ManagerFirst, notice that the answer can't be that large. Even the worst case: one developer works one day of the week, responsible for a $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ part project, the first $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ of his workdays are holidays. It's just $$$7 \cdot (2 \cdot 10^5 + 2 \cdot 10^5)$$$.Thus, we'd like to iterate over time and complete project parts exactly as they are due. If we manage to deduce the parts that have to be completed during the current day, the complexity will be limited by the total number of parts plus the maximum time.To determine that, I propose to maintain the following data structures. First, maintain $$$7$$$ vectors of maps: for each day of the week, maintain pairs (the developer, the number of projects they are currently the blocking person for). Each developer is only counted in days they work at and only if they have a non-zero number of projects. Second, maintain $$$n$$$ vectors of sets: for each developer, maintain the projects they are currently the blocking person for.To process a day, extract all pairs from the map for the current day of the week. All these developers will complete a part of a project. The index of that project is the first element in the corresponding set. Update all maps and sets and proceed. If the number of projects for any developers becomes zero, remove them from the maps.If the current day is a holiday, just skip it. Solution (awoo)#include <bits/stdc++.h>

}1765M - Minimum LCMIdea: BledDest, preparation: Neon Tutorial1765M - Minimum LCMSuppose $$$a \le b$$$. Let's show that if $$$b \bmod a \ne 0$$$, the answer is suboptimal. If $$$b \bmod a = 0$$$, then $$$LCM(a, b) = b$$$, so the answer is less than $$$n$$$. But if $$$b \bmod a \ne 0$$$, then $$$LCM(a, b)$$$ is at least $$$2b$$$, and $$$b$$$ is at least $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$, so in this case, the answer is at least $$$n$$$.Okay, now we know that in the optimal answer, $$$b \bmod a = 0$$$. This also means that $$$n \bmod a = 0$$$, since $$$n = a + b$$$. So we need to search for $$$a$$$ only among the divisors of $$$n$$$, and it is possible to iterate through all of them in $$$O(n^{0.5})$$$. Solution (Neon)#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int a = 1;
    for (int g = 2; g * g <= n; ++g) {
      if (n % g == 0) {
        a = n / g;
        break;
      }
    }
    cout << a << ' ' << n - a << '\n';

 1765N - Number ReductionIdea: Neon, preparation: Neon Tutorial1765N - Number ReductionTo begin with, in order to minimize the answer, we minimize the first (highest) digit of the answer. Let's check if the highest digit can be equal to $$$1$$$. To do this, there must be $$$1$$$ in the number among the first $$$k+1$$$ digits (because we can delete no more than $$$k$$$ of them). If $$$1$$$ is not among the first $$$k+1$$$ digits, then we proceed to check $$$2$$$, then $$$3$$$ and so on. Otherwise, let's say that this digit is the first digit of the answer, and remove all the digits before it and itself from the number $$$x$$$, reducing the value of $$$k$$$. For example, if $$$x=741819$$$ and $$$k=4$$$, then after the operation $$$ans=1$$$, $$$x=819$$$ and $$$k=2$$$. Thus, we get the same problem, but with new values of $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$, which is solved by the same algorithm (searching for the minimum first digit). The only difference is that after the first such iteration, the first digit can be equal to $$$0$$$.It remains to understand how to quickly check whether the digit $$$d$$$ is among the first $$$k+1$$$ positions of the number. To do this, let's write, for each digit, its positions in the original number $$$x$$$. At each iteration of the algorithm, the current value of $$$x$$$ is some suffix of the original $$$x$$$, let it be the suffix of positions $$$[lst; n]$$$, where $$$n$$$ is the length of the original $$$x$$$. Now to check the digit, it is enough to look into its array of positions and find the minimum occurrence greater than or equal to $$$lst$$$. To do this, you can use binary search or delete all positions that are strictly less than $$$lst$$$ from the array or set (because the value of $$$lst$$$ only increases for subsequent iterations of the algorithm).Thus, the solution works in $$$O(n)$$$ or $$$O(n\log{n})$$$ time.
