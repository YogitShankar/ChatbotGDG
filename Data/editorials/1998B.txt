Solution:
1998A - Find K Distinct Points with Fixed Center IdeaChose A1=(K∗XC,K∗YC).The remaining points such that sum of x coordinates and y coordinates is 0.My submission — 275541733 Video editorial1998B - Minimize Equal Sum Subarrays Hint 1Sum of all elements will be equal in both permutations.So no of such (i,j) is atleast 1.Can you find a permutation Q such that this count remains 1? Hint 2Set Qi=1 if Pi=N,Set Qi=1+Pi if Pi<N, otherwise  Hint 3Set Qi=P(i+1)modN My submission — 275547485 Video editorial1998C - Perform Operations to Maximize ScoreMy solution is a bit overkill, check out neal submission 275613185 Hint 1Lets forget about Ai and focus on Ci first.If we have and array of N−1 elements Ai and binary array of N−1 elements Bi.What is the maximum median we can get using atmax K operations? Hint 2We can binary search for median.We can directly count how many elements are more than mid, and how many elements we can make more than median.Using segment tree, walk on segment tree and blah blah blah............My submission — 275635373 Video editorial1998E1 - Eliminating Balls With Merging (Easy Version) Hint 1Notice that at any point all the elements are sum of continous subarray.  Hint 2Define a function solve(L,R) which returns true, if we can convert element with weight ∑AL+AL+1+....+AR into an element with weight ∑A Hint 3Use greedy, for fixed index L and R, find a minimum nxtL such that ∑AnxtL+AnxtL+1+...+AL−1≤AL+AL+1+....+AR, make a direct jump to nxtL,R segment.  Hint 4Do similar for nxtR, and memorise all the answer of solve function.

Hint 2Modify the Solve function to now return what is the minimum index Lj, instead of boolean earlier.Basically find minimum Lj such that element j can become ∑A1+A2+...ALj Hint 3Also for each index i precalcute how much right it can go.Use this to calculate Rj based on Lj.  Hint 4Otherway around you can also return this range in your solve function. My submission — 275619707 Video editorial
