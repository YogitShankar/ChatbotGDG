Hint 2No of palindromes that consist of only a is 2Ca−1 and similarly for eiou.So lowerbound on no of palindrome is 2Ca+2Ce+2Ci+2Co+2Cu−5Does there exists a permutation where this lowerbound is achievable? Hint 3This lowerbound is achieved on strings of form aaaaaaaaaeeeeeeeeeeiiiiiiiiiioooooooooouuuuuuuuu Hint 4How to find optimal values of Ca,Ce,Ci,Co,Cu? Hint 5In optimal answer |Cx−Cy|≤1.You can try to prove it using exchange arguments technique.My submission — 281138271 Video Editorial2005B1 - The Strict Teacher (Easy Version) HintSeparately solve for cases when David is on left side of both the teachers, in between the teachers and right side of both the teachers.My submission — 281147180 Video Editorial2005B2 - The Strict Teacher (Hard Version) Hint 1We need the nearest teacher on the left side and right side, and then B1 solution works.  Hint 2To find the nearest teachers, you can either use binary search or use lower_bound stl function.My submission — 281146462 Video Editorial2005C - Lazy Narek Hint 1Let's first simplify the scoring function.  Hint 2Let's say we have fixed string t, you do we find the score?Let the no of narek strings formed is c and total no of chars narek is t.No of chars found by chatgpt will be t−5∗c.The score is 5∗c−(t−5∗c)=10∗c−t.  Hint 3Another way to see this cost function is -Chatgpt will reduce score by -1 whenever it finds any of the char narek.We will increase by +10 whenever we complete the string narek.  Hint 4Now, dp[i][j] can be the maximum score so far such that we have processed the first i string, and we have got the first j chars of uncompleted narek string (which is required for +10).My submission — 281162411 Video Editorial2005D - Alter the GCDMy solution has a bad time complexity. Anyways you can check what I did and what the reasoning was.My submission — 281180437 TLE solution2005E1 - Subtangle Game (Easy Version) Hint 1Use Minimax Algorithm Hint 2Let's say we know what positions a player playing i+1 can select and still win the game.Can we use this information to find all the positions that a player playing i move can select?  Hint 3A player selecting r,c on the move i wins the game if and only if there is no position in [r+1...n][c+1...m] which player playing i+1 move can select and win.  Hint 3With careful implementation, one can solve the above problem in O(N∗M∗L) time complexity. My submission — 281195816 Video Editorial2005E2 - Subtangle Game (Hard Version) Hint 1First solve E1. Hint 2Consider the following testcase - 1 2 2
2 2 1
2 3 3
If a player has to select 2 from somewhere, they should only select (1,3) or (2,2) or (3,1).Selecting (2,1) instead of (2,2), will just increase no of possible moves for the opponent.  Hint 3We should ignore the nos not present in A.For each nos present X in A and each column C, we can precompute maximum R such that B[R][C]=X.  Hint 4Now, we should play this game only on these indexes.With careful implementation on can solve it in O(N∗M+N∗L).My submission — 281209324 Video Editorial Chat QnA
