Even in university, students need to relax. That is why Sakurakos teacher decided to go on a field trip. It is known that all of the students will be walking in one line. The student with index 𝑖i has some topic of interest which is described as 𝑎𝑖ai. As a teacher, you want to minimise the disturbance of the line of students.The disturbance of the line is defined as the number of neighbouring people with the same topic of interest. In other words, disturbance is the number of indices 𝑗j (1≤𝑗<𝑛1≤j<n) such that 𝑎𝑗=𝑎𝑗+1aj=aj+1.In order to do this, you can choose index 𝑖i (1≤𝑖≤𝑛1≤i≤n) and swap students at positions 𝑖i and 𝑛−𝑖+1n−i+1. You can perform any number of swaps.Your task is to determine the minimal amount of disturbance that you can achieve by doing the operation described above any number of times.

The first line contains one integer 𝑡t (1≤𝑡≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.Each test case is described by two lines.  The first line contains one integer 𝑛n (2≤𝑛≤1052≤n≤105) — the length of the line of students.  The second line contains 𝑛n integers 𝑎𝑖ai (1≤𝑎𝑖≤𝑛1≤ai≤n) — the topics of interest of students in line. It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.

For each test case, output the minimal possible disturbance of the line that you can achieve.

Note
NoteIn the first example, it is necessary to apply the operation to 𝑖=2i=2, thus the array will become [1,2,1,1,3][1,2,1,1,3], with the bold elements indicating those that have swapped places. The disturbance of this array is equal to 11.In the fourth example, it is sufficient to apply the operation to 𝑖=3i=3, thus the array will become [2,1,2,1,2,4][2,1,2,1,2,4]. The disturbance of this array is equal to 00.In the eighth example, it is sufficient to apply the operation to 𝑖=3i=3, thus the array will become [1,4,1,5,3,1,3][1,4,1,5,3,1,3]. The disturbance of this array is equal to 00.
