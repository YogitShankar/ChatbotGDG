Evirir the dragon snuck into a wizard's castle and found a mysterious contraption, and their playful instincts caused them to play with (destroy) it...Evirir the dragon found an array 搗1,搗2,窶ｦ,搗酒搗嫗1,a2,窶ｦ,an of 搗嬾 non-negative integers.In one operation, they can choose a non-empty subarray竏冷 搗獣 of 搗斬 and replace it with the integer mex(搗)mex竅｡(b)窶窶. They want to use this operation any number of times to make 搗斬 only contain zeros. It can be proven that this is always possible under the problem constraints.What is the minimum number of operations needed?竏冷輸n array 搗芯 is a subarray of an array 搗租 if 搗芯 can be obtained from 搗租 by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. 窶窶The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers 搗1,搗2,窶ｦ,搗汝搗惑1,f2,窶ｦ,fk is defined as the smallest non-negative integer 搗･x which does not occur in the collection 搗吐.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 搗｡t (1竕､搗｡竕､2001竕､t竕､200). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer 搗嬾 (1竕､搗帚王501竕､n竕､50), the length of 搗斬.The second line of each test case contains 搗嬾 space-separated integers, 搗1,搗2,窶ｦ,搗酒搗嫗1,a2,窶ｦ,an (0竕､搗酒搗問王1000竕､ai竕､100).It is guaranteed that the sum of 搗嬾 over all test cases does not exceed 500500.

For each test case, output a single integer on a line, the minimum number of operations needed to make 搗斬 contain only zeros.

Note
NoteIn the first test case, Evirir can choose the subarray 搗=[1,2,3]b=[1,2,3] and replace it with mex(1,2,3)=0mex竅｡(1,2,3)=0, changing 搗斬 from [0,1,2,3竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ][0,1,2,3_] to [0,0][0,0] (where the chosen subarray is underlined). Therefore, the answer is 11.In the second test case, 搗斬 already contains only 00s, so no operation is needed.In the third test case, Evirir can change 搗斬 as follows: [1,0,1,0,1竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ]竊端1,2竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ]竊端0][1,0,1,0,1_]竊端1,2_]竊端0]. Here, mex(0,1,0,1)=2mex竅｡(0,1,0,1)=2 and mex(1,2)=0mex竅｡(1,2)=0.In the fourth test case, Evirir can choose 搗獣 to be the entire array 搗斬, changing 搗斬 from [3,1,4,1,5竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ竡ｯ][3,1,4,1,5_] to [0][0].
