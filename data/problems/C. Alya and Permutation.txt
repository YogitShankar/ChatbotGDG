Alya has been given a hard problem. Unfortunately, she is too busy running for student council. Please solve this problem for her.Given an integer 𝑛, construct a permutation 𝑝 of integers 1,2,…,𝑛 that maximizes the value of 𝑘 (which is initially 0) after the following process.Perform 𝑛 operations, on the 𝑖-th operation (𝑖=1,2,…,𝑛),  If 𝑖 is odd, 𝑘=𝑘&𝑝𝑖, where & denotes the bitwise AND operation.  If 𝑖 is even, 𝑘=𝑘|𝑝𝑖, where | denotes the bitwise OR operation.

The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤500) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (5≤𝑛≤2⋅105) — the length of the permutation.It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

For each test case, output the maximum value of 𝑘 in the first line and output the permutation 𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑛 in the second line.If there are multiple such permutations, output any.

Note
NoteFor the first test case, the value of 𝑘 is determined as follows:𝑘=0 initially. On the 1st operation, 1 is odd, so Alya sets 𝑘 to be 𝑘&𝑝1=0&2=0. On the 2nd operation, 2 is even, so Alya sets 𝑘 to be 𝑘|𝑝2=0|1=1. On the 3rd operation, 3 is odd, so Alya sets 𝑘 to be 𝑘&𝑝3=1&3=1. On the 4th operation, 4 is even, so Alya sets 𝑘 to be 𝑘|𝑝4=1|4=5. On the 5th operation, 5 is odd, so Alya sets 𝑘 to be 𝑘&𝑝5=5&5=5.The final value of 𝑘 is 5. It can be shown that the final value of 𝑘 is at most 5 for all permutations of length 5. Another valid output is [2,3,1,4,5].For the second test case, the final value of 𝑘 is 7. It can be shown that the final value of 𝑘 is at most 7 for all permutations of length 6. Other valid outputs include [2,4,1,6,3,5] and [5,2,6,1,3,4].
