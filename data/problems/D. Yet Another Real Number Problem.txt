Three r there are's in strawberry.You are given an array 𝑏b of length 𝑚m. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):   Choose two distinct indices 𝑖i and 𝑗j where 1≤𝐢<𝐣≤𝐦1≤i<j≤m and 𝑏𝑖bi is even, divide 𝑏𝑖bi by 22 and multiply 𝑏𝑗bj by 22.  Your task is to maximize the sum of the array after performing any number of such operations. Since it could be large, output this sum modulo 109+7109+7.Since this problem is too easy, you are given an array 𝑎a of length 𝑛n and need to solve the problem for each prefix of 𝑎a.In other words, denoting the maximum sum of 𝑏b after performing any number of such operations as 𝑓(𝑏)f(b), you need to output 𝑓([𝑎1])f([a1]), 𝑓([𝑎1,𝑎2])f([a1,a2]), ……, 𝑓([𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛])f([a1,a2,…,an]) modulo 109+7109+7 respectively.

The first line contains a single integer 𝑡t (1≤𝑡≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛n (1≤𝑛≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of 𝑎a.The second line contains 𝑛n integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛a1,a2,…,an (1≤𝑎𝑖≤1091≤ai≤109) — the starting values of array 𝑎a.It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛n over all test cases will not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.

For each test case, output 𝑛n integers representing the answer for each prefix of 𝑎a modulo 109+7109+7.
