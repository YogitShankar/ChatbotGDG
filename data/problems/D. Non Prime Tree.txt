You are given a tree with 𝑛 vertices.You need to construct an array 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛 of length 𝑛, consisting of unique integers from 1 to 2⋅𝑛, and such that for each edge 𝑢𝑖↔𝑣𝑖 of the tree, the value |𝑎𝑢𝑖−𝑎𝑣𝑖| is not a prime number.Find any array that satisfies these conditions, or report that there is no such array.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤104). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (2≤𝑛≤2⋅105) — the number of vertices in the tree.The next 𝑛−1 lines contain the edges of the tree, one edge per line. The 𝑖-th line contains two integers 𝑢𝑖 and 𝑣𝑖 (1≤𝑢𝑖,𝑣𝑖≤𝑛; 𝑢𝑖≠𝑣𝑖), denoting the edge between the nodes 𝑢𝑖 and 𝑣𝑖.It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

For each test case, if an array that satisfies the conditions exists, print its elements 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛. Otherwise, print −1.
