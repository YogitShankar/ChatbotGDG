The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers, n, m, and k (2\u2264n,m\u22642\u22c5103, 1\u2264k\u22644\u22c5103).\nEach of the next k lines contains four integers, xi,1, yi,1, xi,2, and yi,2 (1\u2264xi,1<xi,2\u2264n, 1\u2264yi,1,yi,2\u2264m). It is guaranteed that either (xi,2,yi,2)=(xi,1+1,yi,1+1) or (xi,2,yi,2)=(xi,1+1,yi,1\u22121).\nThe pairs of cells are pairwise distinct, i.e. for all 1\u2264i<j\u2264k, it is not true that xi,1=xj,1, yi,1=yj,1, xi,2=xj,2, and yi,2=yj,2.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\u22c5103.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2\u22c5103.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 4\u22c5103.",
