The row-major order of an  grid of characters  is the string obtained by concatenating all the rows, i.e. 

 A_{11}A_{12} \dots A_{1c}A_{21}A_{22} \dots A_{2c} \dots A_{r1}A_{r2} \dots A_{rc}. 
A grid of characters  is bad if there are some two adjacent cells (cells sharing an edge) with the same character.
You are given a positive integer . Consider all strings  consisting of only lowercase Latin letters such that they are not the row-major order of any bad grid. Find any string with the minimum number of distinct characters among all such strings of length .
It can be proven that at least one such string exists under the constraints of the problem.
