The only difference between this problem and the hard version is the constraints on t and n.
You are given an array of n positive integers a1,…,an, and a (possibly negative) integer c.
Across all permutations b1,…,bn of the array a1,…,an, consider the minimum possible value of n−1∑i=1|bi+1−bi−c|. Find the lexicographically smallest permutation b of the array a that achieves this minimum.
A sequence x is lexicographically smaller than a sequence y if and only if one of the following holds:
 x is a prefix of y, but x≠y; in the first position where x and y differ, the sequence x has a smaller element than the corresponding element in y.
