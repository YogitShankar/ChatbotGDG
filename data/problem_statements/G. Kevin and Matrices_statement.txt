Kevin has been transported to Sacred Heart Hospital, which contains all the n×m matrices with integer values in the range [1,v].
Now, Kevin wants to befriend some matrices, but he is willing to befriend a matrix a if and only if the following condition is satisfied:
min1≤i≤n(max1≤j≤mai,j)≤max1≤j≤m(min1≤i≤nai,j).

 \min_{1\le i\le n}\left(\max_{1\le j\le m}a_{i,j}\right)\le\max_{1\le j\le m}\left(\min_{1\le i\le n}a_{i,j}\right). 
Please count how many matrices in Sacred Heart Hospital can be friends with Kevin.
Since Kevin is very friendly, there could be many matrices that meet this condition. Therefore, you only need to output the result modulo 998244353.
