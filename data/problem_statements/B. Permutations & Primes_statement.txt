You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$.
In this problem, the $$$\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of a collection of integers $$$c_1,c_2,\dots,c_k$$$ is defined as the smallest positive integer $$$x$$$ which does not occur in the collection $$$c$$$. 
The primality of an array $$$a_1,\dots,a_n$$$ is defined as the number of pairs $$$(l,r)$$$ such that $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$ and $$$\operatorname{MEX}(a_l,\dots,a_r)$$$ is a prime number. 
Find any permutation of $$$1,2,\dots,n$$$ with the maximum possible primality among all permutations of $$$1,2,\dots,n$$$. 
Note: 
  A prime number is a number greater than or equal to $$$2$$$ that is not divisible by any positive integer except $$$1$$$ and itself. For example, $$$2,5,13$$$ are prime numbers, but $$$1$$$ and $$$6$$$ are not prime numbers.  A permutation of $$$1,2,\dots,n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).
