Hint 1 
 Only the case where the characters on both sides are RL in the simple version needs to be counted. In fact, the numbers at these two positions, RL, must be the same. 
Hint 2 
 Let the number at the RL positions be m, and enumerate the rightmost R position x that is filled with m, and the leftmost L position y that is filled with m. 
Hint 3 
 The case where x>y is easy to resolve. For the case where x<y, analyze the necessary and sufficient conditions for it to hold. 
Hint 4 
 For the final transformed condition, use bitset or convolution to complete the counting.

 2048I2 - Kevin and Puzzle (Hard Version)According to the easy version, we can see that most cases have very few solutions because for LR, LL, and RR, after filling in the inner part, the outer layer only has one unique way to fill. Therefore, if there is no RL layer, the answer must be 1.Next, consider the case where RL is present. Let’s assume that RL is the outermost pair of characters.It can be proved that the numbers at the R and L positions in this RL must be the same. The specific proof is omitted here, but readers can prove this for themselves easily.Let this common value be m. Then, enumerate the rightmost R position x filled with m and the leftmost L position y filled with m. Now, let’s discuss the relationship between x and y:  If x>y, it can be observed that all Ls to the right of x must be filled with m, and all Rs to the right of x have only one way to be filled. The same applies for y. For this case, we can directly enumerate m, then determine the unique positions for x and y, and check if x>y. If x<y, at this point, all Rs to the left of x must be filled with m, and the Ls to the left of x have only one way to be filled. Similarly for the right side of y. Now, consider the section between (x,y). Clearly, m must not appear in the middle, so we can delete x and all Rs to its left, as well as y and all Ls to its right (i.e., remove all positions where the value is m). The resulting sequence is called the remaining sequence. After removing these characters, we solve for the remaining sequence, then add 1 to all the numbers obtained, and finally, add all positions filled with m. Below is an example of an initial sequence, where the red characters are x and y, and the omitted part is the section between (x,y).  Below is the corresponding remaining sequence, with ∗ representing the original sequence positions of x and y.  After filling the remaining sequence, we need to analyze the conditions for adding all positions filled with m: we divide the remaining sequence into three parts: "left", "middle", and "right", with the positions of x and y as boundaries, where the left part contains only Ls, and the right part contains only Rs. The condition to be satisfied is that let the total number of colors in the "left-middle" part be c1, and the total number of colors in the "middle-right" part be c2, then we need m=c1+1=c2+1. Additionally, m must not appear in the remaining sequence. This restriction is equivalent to requiring both the "left-middle" and "middle-right" parts to satisfy d=1. It can be concluded that the remaining sequence satisfies d=1. For the condition c1=c2, it is easy to see that it is equivalent to: let z be the larger of the counts of the left and right parts, then the first z characters of the remaining sequence must all be L, and the last z characters must all be R. The final necessary and sufficient condition is: let x have a Ls to the left, and y have b Rs to the right. Without loss of generality, assume a≥b. Remove the substring between (x,y) (not including x and y). This remaining substring needs to satisfy that the last a−b characters are Rs, and after removing these a−b Rs, the resulting string must satisfy d=1, meaning there is no RL situation when taking the first and last characters. Since d=1, if the remaining sequence satisfies this condition, there will be exactly one way to fill it. Finally, we only need to count the cases separately. The case where x>y can be counted in O(n), for the case where x<y, without loss of generality, assume a≥b, we can enumerate y, calculate the length of the longest consecutive Rs before y, denoted as cnt, so the restriction on a becomes b≤a≤b+cnt.  When cnt=0, the value of a is fixed, but the corresponding x can be chosen from any position in a consecutive block of Rs. We find that because cnt=0, i.e., the position before y is filled with L, then the position after x cannot be filled with R, so x can only be chosen as the last R in the consecutive R block. When cnt>0, we only need to enumerate the values of x. It is easy to see that each x will be counted at most 2 times. Through the above observations, we only need to enumerate O(n) pairs of x and y and check whether they increase the answer by 1. That is, the answer is at the O(n) level.The last problem is: for each given interval [l,r], we need to check if there is any RL situation when taking the first and last characters of this string.A simple solution is to use a bitset to maintain, for example, by scanning r from small to large, and maintaining the existence of RL for each l+r. The time complexity of this approach is O(n2ω), which can be handled by this problem.If using block convolution, a more optimal complexity can be achieved. In fact, if further exploring the properties, the time complexity can be reduced to O(nlog2n) (requiring convolution), which you can explore on your own if you are interested.
