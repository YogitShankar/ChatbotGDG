Lemma:
Suppose the largest value filled is $$$mx$$$, and the number of distinct values is $$$c$$$. Let $$$d = c - mx$$$. Then, $$$d = 0$$$ or $$$d = 1$$$.
Proof:
Clearly, $$$c \le mx + 1$$$. If $$$c < mx$$$, observe where $$$mx$$$ is placed, and a contradiction arises.
Now, consider the leftmost and rightmost characters in sequence $$$s$$$:
If they are
L
and
R
, we can see that both positions must be filled with $$$0$$$, and no other position can be filled with $$$0$$$. For internal positions, whether
L
or
R
, $$$0$$$ counts as a distinct number. Therefore, we can remove these two positions, recursively solve for the remaining part, add $$$1$$$ to all numbers, and then place a $$$0$$$ at both ends.
If both are
L
, the leftmost
L
must be $$$0$$$. Suppose the rightmost
L
is filled with $$$x$$$. It is easy to prove that $$$x$$$ cannot be placed in internal positions. For internal positions, whether
L
or
R
, either $$$0$$$ or $$$x$$$ is counted as a distinct number. So, as in the previous case, we remove the two positions, recursively solve for the remaining part, add $$$1$$$ to all numbers, and then add $$$0$$$ and $$$x$$$ at both ends. The value of $$$x$$$ must be the number of distinct values inside plus 1. This condition is equivalent to the internal region satisfying $$$d = 1$$$.
If both are
R
, the analysis is the same as for the
L
and
L
case.
If the leftmost character is
R
and the rightmost character is
L
, a simple construction is to fill everything with $$$1$$$. In this case, no $$$0$$$ will appear, so this case can only correspond to $$$d = 0$$$.
We recursively remove the leftmost and rightmost characters, solve for the inner region, add $$$1$$$ to all of them, and place $$$0$$$ and $$$x$$$ at both ends.
Now, consider how $$$d$$$ changes:
For the
LR
case, $$$d$$$ remains unchanged.
For
LL
or
RR
, the internal region must satisfy $$$d = 1$$$.
For
RL
, the entire region results in $$$d = 0$$$.
Therefore, consider the outermost
RL
. If it contains
LL
or
RR
inside, there is no solution.
Otherwise, a solution always exists, and it can be easily constructed based on the above process, the time complexity is $$$O(n)$$$.
