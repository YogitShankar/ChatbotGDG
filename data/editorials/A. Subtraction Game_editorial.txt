Problem Solution 1844A 
Hint 1 
 There exists a small n where the second player can win. 
Hint 2 
 If a≥2, then n=1 works. 
Subtraction GameWe present two approaches.Approach 1If a≥2, then n=1 works.Else if a=1 and b≥3, n=2 works.Otherwise, a=1 and b=2, so n=3 works.Approach 2Printing a+b works because no matter what move the first player makes, the second player can respond with the opposite move.The time complexity is O(1) per test case. 
Implementation 
 #include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t,a,b;
    scanf("%d",&t);
    while (t--) {
        scanf("%d %d",&a,&b);
        printf("%d\n",a+b);
    }
    return 0;
}
