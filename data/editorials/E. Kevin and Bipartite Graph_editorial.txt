Hint 1 
 It can be observed that the larger m is, the harder it is to satisfy the conditions. Try to find an upper bound for m.

 2048E - Kevin and Bipartite GraphThe graph has a total of 2nm edges, and each color forms a forest. Therefore, for any given color, there are at most 2n+m−1 edges. Thus, the total number of edges cannot exceed (2n+m−1)n. This gives the condition: (2n+m−1)n≥2nm. Simplifying, we find m≤2n−1.Next, we only need to construct a valid case for m=2n−1 to solve the problem.In fact, this is easy to construct. Since each right-side vertex has a degree of 2n, and there are n total colors, let each color have exactly 2 edges. For any given color, this is equivalent to choosing two left-side vertices to connect (ignoring the existence of the right-side vertices). After 2n−1 connections, the left-side vertices need to form a tree. It turns out that connecting the left-side vertices into a chain suffices. During construction, we can cycle the colors of the first right-side vertex. For example, for n=4 and m=7, the result looks like this: 1 4 4 3 3 2 2
1 1 4 4 3 3 2
2 1 1 4 4 3 3
2 2 1 1 4 4 3
3 2 2 1 1 4 4
3 3 2 2 1 1 4
4 3 3 2 2 1 1
4 4 3 3 2 2 1Thus, a simple construction method is as follows: for left-side vertex i and right-side vertex j, the color of the edge connecting them is given by: ⌊(i+j)mod2n2⌋+1
