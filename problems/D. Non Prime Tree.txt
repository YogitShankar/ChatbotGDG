You are given a tree with nn vertices.You need to construct an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an of length nn, consisting of unique integers from 11 to 2⋅n2⋅n, and such that for each edge ui↔viui↔vi of the tree, the value |aui−avi||aui−avi| is not a prime number.Find any array that satisfies these conditions, or report that there is no such array.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (2≤n≤2⋅1052≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of vertices in the tree.The next n−1n−1 lines contain the edges of the tree, one edge per line. The ii-th line contains two integers uiui and vivi (1≤ui,vi≤n1≤ui,vi≤n; ui≠viui≠vi), denoting the edge between the nodes uiui and vivi.It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.

For each test case, if an array that satisfies the conditions exists, print its elements a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. Otherwise, print −1−1.
