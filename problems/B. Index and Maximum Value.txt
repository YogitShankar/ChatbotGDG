After receiving yet another integer array a1,a2,…,an at her birthday party, Index decides to perform some operations on it.Formally, there are m operations that she is going to perform in order. Each of them belongs to one of the two types:  + l r. Given two integers l and r, for all 1≤i≤n such that l≤ai≤r, set ai:=ai+1.  - l r. Given two integers l and r, for all 1≤i≤n such that l≤ai≤r, set ai:=ai−1. For example, if the initial array a=[7,1,3,4,3], after performing the operation + 2 4, the array a=[7,1,4,5,4]. Then, after performing the operation - 1 10, the array a=[6,0,3,4,3].Index is curious about the maximum value in the array a. Please help her find it after each of the m operations.

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1≤n≤105, 1≤m≤105) — the length of the array and the number of operations.The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — the initial array a.Then m lines follow, each line corresponds to the operation, in the following format: c l r (c∈{+,-}, l and r are integers, 1≤l≤r≤109) — the description of the operation.Note that the elements ai may not satisfy 1≤ai≤109 after some operations, as it is shown in the example.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 105.

For each test case, output one single line containing m integers, with the i-th of them describing the maximum value of the array after the i-th operation.
