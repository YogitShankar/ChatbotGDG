You are given two integers n and k.In one operation, you can subtract any power of k from n. Formally, in one operation, you can replace n by (n−kx) for any non-negative integer x.Find the minimum number of operations required to make n equal to 0.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1≤n,k≤109).

For each test case, output the minimum number of operations on a new line.
