You are given three non-negative integers b, c, and d.Please find a non-negative integer a∈[0,261] such that (a|b)−(a&c)=d, where | and & denote the bitwise OR operation and the bitwise AND operation, respectively.If such an a exists, print its value. If there is no solution, print a single integer −1. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤105). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains three positive integers b, c, and d (0≤b,c,d≤1018).

For each test case, output the value of a, or −1 if there is no solution. Please note that a must be non-negative and cannot exceed 261.
