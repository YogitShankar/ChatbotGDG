It is already the year $$$3024$$$, ideas for problems have long run out, and the olympiad now takes place in a modified individual format. The olympiad consists of $$$n$$$ problems, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th problem has its own score $$$a_i$$$ and a certain parameter $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le n$$$).Initially, the testing system gives the participant the first problem. When the participant is given the $$$i$$$-th problem, they have two options:   They can submit the problem and receive $$$a_i$$$ points;  They can skip the problem, in which case they will never be able to submit it. Then, the testing system selects the next problem for the participant from problems with indices $$$j$$$, such that:   If he submitted the $$$i$$$-th problem, it looks at problems with indices $$$j < i$$$;  If he skipped the $$$i$$$-th problem, it looks at problems with indices $$$j \leq b_i$$$. Among these problems, it selects the problem with the maximum index that it has not previously given to the participant (he has neither submitted nor skipped it before). If there is no such problem, then the competition for the participant ends, and their result is equal to the sum of points for all submitted problems. In particular, if the participant submits the first problem, then the competition for them ends. Note that the participant receives each problem at most once.Prokhor has prepared thoroughly for the olympiad, and now he can submit any problem. Help him determine the maximum number of points he can achieve.

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 4 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of problems in the olympiad.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the scores of the problems.The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq b_i \leq n$$$) — the parameters of the problems.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of points that Prokhor can achieve.
