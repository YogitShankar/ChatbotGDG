Evirir the dragon snuck into a wizard's castle and found a mysterious contraption, and their playful instincts caused them to play with (destroy) it...Evirir the dragon found an array a1,a2,…,an of n non-negative integers.In one operation, they can choose a non-empty subarray∗ b of a and replace it with the integer mex(b)†. They want to use this operation any number of times to make a only contain zeros. It can be proven that this is always possible under the problem constraints.What is the minimum number of operations needed?∗An array c is a subarray of an array d if c can be obtained from d by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. †The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers f1,f2,…,fk is defined as the smallest non-negative integer x which does not occur in the collection f.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤200). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤50), the length of a.The second line of each test case contains n space-separated integers, a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤100).It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 500.

For each test case, output a single integer on a line, the minimum number of operations needed to make a contain only zeros.
