Karel is a salesman in a car dealership. The dealership has nn different models of cars. There are aiai cars of the ii-th model. Karel is an excellent salesperson and can convince customers to buy up to xx cars (of Karel's choice), as long as the cars are from different models.Determine the minimum number of customers Karel has to bring in to sell all the cars.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and xx (1≤n≤5⋅1051≤n≤5⋅105; 1≤x≤101≤x≤10) — the number of different models of cars and the maximum number of cars Karel can convince a customer to buy.The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109) — the number of cars of each model.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅1055⋅105.

For each test case, output the minimum possible number of customers needed to sell all the cars.
