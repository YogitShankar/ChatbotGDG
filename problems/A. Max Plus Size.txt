EnV - Dynasty⠀You are given an array a1,a2,…,an of positive integers.You can color some elements of the array red, but there cannot be two adjacent red elements (i.e., for 1≤i≤n−1, at least one of ai and ai+1 must not be red).Your score is the maximum value of a red element plus the number of red elements. Find the maximum score you can get.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤500). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤100) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1000) — the given array.

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible score you can get after coloring some elements red according to the statement.
