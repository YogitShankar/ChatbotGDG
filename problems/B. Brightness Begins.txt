Imagine you have nn light bulbs numbered 1,2,…,n. Initially, all bulbs are on. To flip the state of a bulb means to turn it off if it used to be on, and to turn it on otherwise.Next, you do the following:  for each i=1,2,…,n, flip the state of all bulbs j such that j is divisible by i†. After performing all operations, there will be several bulbs that are still on. Your goal is to make this number exactly k.Find the smallest suitable n such that after performing the operations there will be exactly k bulbs on. We can show that an answer always exists.† An integer x is divisible by y if there exists an integer z such that x=y⋅z.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single integer k (1≤k≤1018).

For each test case, output n — the minimum number of bulbs.
