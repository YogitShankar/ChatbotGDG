One fine evening, Alice sat down to play the classic game "Connect the Dots", but with a twist.To play the game, Alice draws a straight line and marks nn points on it, indexed from 11 to n. Initially, there are no arcs between the points, so they are all disjoint. After that, Alice performs m operations of the following type:  She picks three integers ai, di (1≤di≤10), and ki.  She selects points ai,ai+di,ai+2di,ai+3di,…,ai+ki⋅di and connects each pair of these points with arcs. After performing all m operations, she wants to know the number of connected components† these points form. Please help her find this number.† Two points are said to be in one connected component if there is a path between them via several (possibly zero) arcs and other points.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤105). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1≤n≤2⋅105, 1≤m≤2⋅105).The i-th of the following m lines contains three integers ai, di, and ki (1≤ai≤ai+ki⋅di≤n, 1≤di≤10, 0≤ki≤n).It is guaranteed that both the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2⋅105.

For each test case, output the number of connected components.
