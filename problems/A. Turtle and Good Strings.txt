Turtle thinks a string s is a good string if there exists a sequence of strings t1,t2,…,tk (k is an arbitrary integer) such that:  k≥2.  s=t1+t2+…+tk, where + represents the concatenation operation. For example, abc=a+bc.  For all 1≤i<j≤k, the first character of ti isn't equal to the last character of tj. Turtle is given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Please tell him whether the string s is a good string!

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤500). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤100) — the length of the string.The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

For each test case, output "YES" if the string s is a good string, and "NO" otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
