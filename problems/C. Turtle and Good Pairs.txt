Turtle gives you a string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.Turtle considers a pair of integers (i,j) (1≤i<j≤n) to be a pleasant pair if and only if there exists an integer k such that i≤k<j and both of the following two conditions hold:  sk≠sk+1;  sk≠si or sk+1≠sj. Besides, Turtle considers a pair of integers (i,j) (1≤i<j≤n) to be a good pair if and only if si=sj or (i,j) is a pleasant pair.Turtle wants to reorder the string s so that the number of good pairs is maximized. Please help him!

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the string.The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

For each test case, output the string s after reordering so that the number of good pairs is maximized. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
