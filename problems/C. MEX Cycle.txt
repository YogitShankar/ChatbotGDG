Evirir the dragon has many friends. They have 3 friends! That is one more than the average dragon.You are given integers nn, x, and y. There are n dragons sitting in a circle. The dragons are numbered 1,2,…,n. For each i (1≤i≤n), dragon i is friends with dragon i−1 and i+1, where dragon 0 is defined to be dragon n and dragon n+1 is defined to be dragon 1. Additionally, dragons x and y are friends with each other (if they are already friends, this changes nothing). Note that all friendships are mutual.Output n non-negative integers a1,a2,…,an such that for each dragon i (1≤i≤n), the following holds:   Let f1,f2,…,fk be the friends of dragon i. Then ai=mex(af1,af2,…,afk).∗ ∗The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers c1,c2,…,cm is defined as the smallest non-negative integer t which does not occur in the collection c.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n, x, y (3≤n≤2⋅105, 1≤x<y≤n).It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

For each test case, output n space-separated non-negative integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤109) on a line that satisfy the condition in the statement. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be proven that under the problem constraints, a solution with 0≤ai≤109 always exists.
