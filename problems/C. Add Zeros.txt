You're given an array a initially containing n integers. In one operation, you must do the following:  Choose a position i such that 1<i≤|a| and ai=|a|+1−i, where |a| is the current size of the array.  Append i−1 zeros onto the end of a. After performing this operation as many times as you want, what is the maximum possible length of the array a?

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤1000). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains n (1≤n≤3⋅105) — the length of the array a.The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1012).It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105.

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible length of a after performing some sequence of operations.
