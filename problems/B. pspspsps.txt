Cats are attracted to pspspsps, but Evirir, being a dignified dragon, is only attracted to pspspsps with oddly specific requirements...Given a string s=s1s2…sn of length n consisting of characters p, s, and . (dot), determine whether a permutation∗ p of length n exists, such that for all integers i (1≤i≤n):   If si is p, then [p1,p2,…,pi] forms a permutation (of length i);  If si is s, then [pi,pi+1,…,pn] forms a permutation (of length n−i+1);  If si is ., then there is no additional restriction. ∗A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤500), the length of s.The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n that consists of the characters p, s, and ..It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000.

For each test case, output YES or NO on a line. Output YES if there is such a permutation and NO otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
