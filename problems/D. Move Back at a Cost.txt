You are given an array of integers a of length n. You can perform the following operation zero or more times:   In one operation choose an index i (1≤i≤n), assign ai:=ai+1, and then move ai to the back of the array (to the rightmost position). For example, if a=[3,5,1,9], and you choose i=2, the array becomes [3,1,9,6]. Find the lexicographically smallest∗ array you can get by performing these operations.∗An array c is lexicographically smaller than an array d if and only if one of the following holds:   c is a prefix of d, but c≠d; or  in the first position where c and d differ, the array c has a smaller element than the corresponding element in d.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤105), the length of the array.The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109), the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.

For each test case, print the lexicographically smallest array you can get.
