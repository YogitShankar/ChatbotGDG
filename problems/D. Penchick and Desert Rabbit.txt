Dedicated to pushing himself to his limits, Penchick challenged himself to survive the midday sun in the Arabian Desert!While trekking along a linear oasis, Penchick spots a desert rabbit preparing to jump along a line of palm trees. There are n trees, each with a height denoted by ai.The rabbit can jump from the i-th tree to the j-th tree if exactly one of the following conditions is true:  j<i and aj>ai: the rabbit can jump backward to a taller tree.  j>i and aj<ai: the rabbit can jump forward to a shorter tree. For each i from 1 to n, determine the maximum height among all trees that the rabbit can reach if it starts from the i-th tree.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤5⋅105). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤5⋅105) — the number of trees.The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n) — the height of the trees.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105.

For each test case, output n integers. The i-th integer should contain the maximum height among all trees that the rabbit can reach if it starts from the i-th tree.
