An integer between 1 and n is written on each card: specifically, for each i from 1 to n, you have ai cards which have the number i written on them.There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k coins, so you can buy at most k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain any integer between 1 and n, inclusive.After buying the new cards, you must partition all your cards into decks, according to the following rules:   all the decks must have the same size;  there are no pairs of cards with the same value in the same deck. Find the maximum possible size of a deck after buying cards and partitioning them optimally.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers n, k (1≤n≤2⋅105, 0≤k≤1016) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins.The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤1010, ∑ai≥1) — the number of cards of type i you have at the beginning, for each 1≤i≤n.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible size of a deck if you operate optimally.
