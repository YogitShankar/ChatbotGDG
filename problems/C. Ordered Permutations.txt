Consider a permutation∗ p1,p2,…,pn of integers from 1 to n. We can introduce the following sum for it†:S(p)=∑1≤l≤r≤nmin(pl,pl+1,…,pr)Let us consider all permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of S(p). Output the k-th of them in lexicographical‡order, or report that there are less than k of them.∗A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). †For example:   For the permutation [1,2,3] the value of S(p) is equal to min(1)+min(1,2)+min(1,2,3)+min(2)+min(2,3)+min(3)= 1+1+1+2+2+3=10  For the permutation [2,4,1,3] the value of S(p) is equal to min(2)+min(2,4)+min(2,4,1)+min(2,4,1,3) + min(4)+min(4,1)+min(4,1,3) + min(1)+min(1,3) + min(3)= 2+2+1+1+4+1+1+1+1+3=17. ‡An array a is lexicographically smaller than an array b if and only if one of the following holds:   a is a prefix of b, but a≠b; or  in the first position where a and b differ, the array a has a smaller element than the corresponding element in b.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1≤n≤2⋅105; 1≤k≤1012) — the length of the permutation and the index number of the desired permutation.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

For each test case, if there are less than k suitable permutations, print −1.Otherwise, print the k-th suitable permutation.
