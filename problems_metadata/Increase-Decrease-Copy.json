        "Let's fix the index of the element to be copied (denote it as ii). For all other elements of the array, the number of required operations is |aj\u2212bj||aj\u2212bj| for all j\u2260ij\u2260i.",
        "Consider the case when ai\u2264biai\u2264bi (similar to the case when ai\u2265biai\u2265bi). There are three possible relative location of the desired element bn+1bn+1:",
        "As you can see, regardless of the case, |bi\u2212ai||bi\u2212ai| is also added to the answer. So the answer looks like this: \u2211j=1n|bj\u2212aj|\u2211j=1n|bj\u2212aj| plus some extra operations to get bn+1bn+1. That extra value is equal to the minimum value of f(i)f(i) over all indices ii, where f(i)f(i) is equal to 1+|bn+1\u2212ai|1+|bn+1\u2212ai| or 11 or 1+|bn+1\u2212bi|1+|bn+1\u2212bi| depending on the cases described above."
