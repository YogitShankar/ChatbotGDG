        "Let's try to solve the problem if all the numbers in the sequence are equal to 44. If the number of elements is even, the bitwise XOR is zero, and if it's odd, then it's equal to 44. By removing one 44 at a time, Eve will change the parity, so the answer will be \u230ap42\u230b\u230ap42\u230b.",
        "Suppose there are some other numbers in the sequence besides 44. For Bob to win, the number of 44s still needs to be even. Therefore, we can solve the problem for the remaining numbers separately from the fours.",
        "One of the solutions uses dynamic programming. Let's denote dpi,j,kdpi,j,k as the maximum number of Bob's wins, if there were initially ii ones, jj twos, and kk threes. Since an empty sequence is not considered in the answer, then dp0,0,0=0dp0,0,0=0. We will iterate over which number to remove, and get the following transitions: dpi,j,k=max(dpi\u22121,j,k,dpi,j\u22121,k,dpi,j,k\u22121)+x(i,j,k)dpi,j,k=max(dpi\u22121,j,k,dpi,j\u22121,k,dpi,j,k\u22121)+x(i,j,k). Here, x(i,j,k)=1x(i,j,k)=1 if the bitwise XOR of ii ones, jj twos, and kk threes is zero, and x(i,j,k)=0x(i,j,k)=0 otherwise. The complexity of calculating these values is O(N3)O(N3), where N=200N=200.",
        "Another solution is analytical. Bob wins in two cases: if the number of ones, twos, and threes is even; if the number of ones, twos, and threes is odd. In the first case, the bitwise XOR is zero, because each number occurs an even number of times, and in the second case, 1\u22952\u22953=01\u22952\u22953=0.",
        "To maintain the parities, Eve needs to remove the same number, so with two removals, Bob will win once. If the second condition is not initially met, it is always more advantageous to remove numbers to reach the first case, then the answer is \u22113i=1\u230acnti2\u230b\u2211i=13\u230acnti2\u230b. If the second condition is already met, then 11 needs to be added to the answer."
