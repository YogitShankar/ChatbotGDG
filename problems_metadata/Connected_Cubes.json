        "First, extend each of the even columns up by n+k\u22121n+k\u22121 spaces, keeping all cubes in a given vertical column the same color:",
        "Then, for the odd columns, do something similar, except we use the bottom n\u22121n\u22121 rows to \"bend\" them around so the tops point out to the right:",

        "Now, each initial cube in the nn by mm grid corresponds to one of these extended rows or columns, each of which is a connected group. Fill in the remaining columns between the even columns with kk rows each. The ii-th of these should be color ii.",
