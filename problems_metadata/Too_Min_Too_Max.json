        "What will be answer if there were only 44 elements in the array?",
        "Suppose if there were only 44 elements in the array. Let them be a\u2264b\u2264c\u2264da\u2264b\u2264c\u2264d. Then the answer will be maximum of the three cases which are listed as follows:-",
        "so clearly 2\u2217(d+c)\u22122\u2217(a+b)2\u2217(d+c)\u22122\u2217(a+b) is the maximum.",
        "So, to maximize this we can set dd, cc as large as possible and aa, bb as small as possible i.e. d=and=an, c=an\u22121c=an\u22121, b=a2b=a2 and a=a1a=a1 where aiai means ithith element in sorted order of given array."
