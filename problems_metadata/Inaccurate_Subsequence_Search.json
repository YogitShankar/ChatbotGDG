        "How to check if two arrays are good? For each element of bb, try to pair it with an element from array aa. If we managed to create kk or more pairs, then the arrays are good.",
        "Since rearranging the elements of the array is allowed, we will maintain three multisets CC, DD, and EE. In DD, we will store all elements from bb for which we found a pair, and in CC and EE, all elements from bb and aa for which a pair was not found, i.e., C\u2229E=\u2205C\u2229E=\u2205. Then the arrays are good if |D|\u2265k|D|\u2265k.",
        "It remains to understand how to find all good subsegments using this data organization. Suppose we shift the left boundary ll by 11, simultaneously moving the right boundary, where r=l+m\u22121r=l+m\u22121. We need to remove the pair with the element alal from DD, if it exists, and immediately try to find a replacement for the removed pair in EE. After that, we try to find a pair for arar from CC, and if a pair cannot be found, we place the element in EE.",
        "The complexity of the solution is O(nlogn)O(nlog\u2061n) or O(n)O(n) if a hash table is used."
