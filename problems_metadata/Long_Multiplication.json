        "Proof: let's denote the sum of the numbers as ss, the smallest number as s2\u2212as2\u2212a and the largest number as s2+as2+a. Then the product is equal to (s2\u2212a)(s2+a)=(s2)2\u2212a2(s2\u2212a)(s2+a)=(s2)2\u2212a2. We can see that, the smaller aa (the half of difference), the larger the product.",
        "In order to get the minimum difference, we can use the following algorithm: let ii be the smallest index (the most significant digit) such that xi\u2260yixi\u2260yi and set the maximum digit among xixi and yiyi to the number xx and smallest to the number yy; thus xx is definitely greater than yy, then the less significant digits should be the maximum possible for the number yy (i.\u2009e. the inequality xj\u2264yjxj\u2264yj must hold for all j>ij>i)."
