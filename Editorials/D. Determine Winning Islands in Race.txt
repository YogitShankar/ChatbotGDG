Hint 1Sum of all elements will be equal in both permutations.So no of such (i,j)(i,j) is atleast 1.Can you find a permutation QQ such that this count remains 1?

Hint 2Set Qi=1Qi=1 if Pi=NPi=N,Set Qi=1+PiQi=1+Pi if Pi<NPi<N, otherwise 

Hint 3Set Qi=P(i+1)modNQi=P(i+1)modN

Hint 1Lets forget about AiAi and focus on CiCi first.If we have and array of N−1N−1 elements AiAi and binary array of N−1N−1 elements BiBi.What is the maximum median we can get using atmax KK operations?

Hint 2We can binary search for median.We can directly count how many elements are more than mid, and how many elements we can make more than median.Using segment tree, walk on segment tree and blah blah blah............

Hint 1Notice that at any point all the elements are sum of continous subarray. 

Hint 2Define a function solve(L,R) which returns true, if we can convert element with weight ∑AL+AL+1+....+AR∑AL+AL+1+....+AR into an element with weight ∑A∑A

Hint 3Use greedy, for fixed index LL and RR, find a minimum nxtLnxtL such that ∑AnxtL+AnxtL+1+...+AL−1≤AL+AL+1+....+AR∑AnxtL+AnxtL+1+...+AL−1≤AL+AL+1+....+AR, make a direct jump to nxtL,RnxtL,R segment. 

Hint 4Do similar for nxtRnxtR, and memorise all the answer of solve function.

Hint 1For each element jj there is a range (Lj,Rj)(Lj,Rj) in which it can be present as last elemt.

Hint 2Modify the Solve function to now return what is the minimum index LjLj, instead of boolean earlier.Basically find minimum LjLj such that element jj can become ∑A1+A2+...ALj∑A1+A2+...ALj

Hint 3Also for each index ii precalcute how much right it can go.Use this to calculate RjRj based on LjLj. 

Hint 4Otherway around you can also return this range in your solve function.
