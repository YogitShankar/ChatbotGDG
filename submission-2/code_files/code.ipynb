    "You:  It has finally been decided to build a roof over the football field in School 179. Its construction will require placing n consecutive vertical pillars. Furthermore, the headmaster wants the heights of all the pillars to form a permutation p of integers from 0 to n−1, where pi is the height of the i-th pillar from the left (1≤i≤n). As the chief, you know that the cost of construction of consecutive pillars is equal to the maximum value of the bitwise XOR of heights of all pairs of adjacent pillars. In other words, the cost of construction is equal to max1≤i≤n−1pi⊕pi+1, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. Find any sequence of pillar heights p of length n with the smallest construction cost. In this problem, a permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 0 to n−1 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,0,4] is a permutation, but [1,0,1] is not a permutation (1 appears twice in the array) and [1,0,3] is also not a permutation (n=3, but 3 is in the array). Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). Description of the test cases follows. The only line for each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of pillars for the construction of the roof. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105. For each test case print n integers p1, p2, …, pn — the sequence of pillar heights with the smallest construction cost. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. For n=2 there are 2 sequences of pillar heights:  For n=3 there are 6 sequences of pillar heights: \n",

    "Bot:  Welcome to our competitive programming chat! I'll be your assistant, and we can work through problems together.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've provided a section titled \"Similar Problem,\" which is problem 1632B - Roof Construction. This problem involves finding the minimum cost of constructing a roof with n consecutive vertical pillars, where the cost is determined by the maximum value of the bitwise XOR of heights of adjacent pillars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The cost of construction is a power of two.\n",
    "2. The cost of construction is 2k, where k is the highest set bit in n−1.\n",
    "3. There will always be a pair of adjacent elements where one of them has the k-th bit set and the other one doesn't, so the cost is at least 2k.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple construction that reaches this minimum cost is to have all numbers with their k-th bit set, followed by all numbers without the k-th bit set. This sequence ensures that there are no adjacent elements with different k-th bits, minimizing the cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's move on to the next step. Since you've asked me to continue our chat as if it were a normal conversation, I'll ask: How can I assist you further? Do you have any specific questions about this problem or would you like to discuss other topics related to competitive programming?\n",

    "Bot:  So you're excited that the previous solution worked for you. That's great!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how can I help you with the current problem you'd like to tackle? Is there a specific problem you'd like to work on together, or do you need help understanding a particular concept or technique in competitive programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I noticed we have a conversation about problem 1632B - Roof Construction earlier. If you're still stuck on that one or would like to discuss it further, feel free to bring it up!\n",

A simple construction that reaches it is 2k−1, 2k−2, …, 0, 2k, 2k+1, …, n−1.Time complexity: O(n)Bonus: count the number of permutations with the minimum cost. Solution codes C++ code.
