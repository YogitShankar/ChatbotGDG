1409A - Yet Another Two Integers ProblemIdea: vovuh Tutorial1409A - Yet Another Two Integers ProblemWe can add or subtract 10 until the difference between 𝑎 and 𝑏 becomes less than 10. And if it is not 0 after all such moves, we need one additional move.Let 𝑑=|𝑎−𝑏| is the absolute difference between 𝑎 and 𝑏. The final answer is ⌊𝑑10⌋ plus one if 𝑑mod10>0. This formula can be represented as 𝑑 divided by 10 rounded up, in other words ⌊𝑑+910⌋. Solution#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
#ifdef _DEBUG
	freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
//	freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
	
	int t;
	cin >> t;
	while (t--) {
		int a, b;
		cin >> a >> b;
		cout << (abs(a - b) + 9) / 10 << endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
