1692A - MarathonIdea: mesanu Tutorial1692A - MarathonWe can re-word the problem to count the number of numbers from 𝑏,𝑐,𝑑 that are larger than 𝑎. A possible way to do this is by keeping a variable that gets incremented every time we checked using the if statement whether a number is larger than 𝑎. The complexity is (1). Solutiont = int(input())
for test in range(t):
    a,b,c,d = map(int, input().split())
    rs = (b > a) + (c > a) + (d > a)
    print(rs)
