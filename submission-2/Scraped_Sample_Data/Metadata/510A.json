    "description": "Fox Ciel starts to learn programming. The first task is drawing a fox! However, that turns out to be too hard for a beginner, so she decides to draw a snake instead.\nA snake is a pattern on a n by m table. Denote c-th cell of r-th row as (r, c). The tail of the snake is located at (1, 1), then it's body extends to (1, m), then goes down 2 rows to (3, m), then goes left to (3, 1) and so on.\nYour task is to draw this snake for Fox Ciel: the empty cells should be represented as dot characters ('.') and the snake cells should be filled with number signs ('#').\nConsider sample tests in order to understand the snake pattern.",
