    "description": "Timur loves codeforces. That's why he has a string\ns\nhaving length\n10\nmade containing only lowercase Latin letters. Timur wants to know how many indices string\ns\ndiffers from the string \"codeforces\".\nFor example string\ns=\n\"coolforsez\" differs from \"codeforces\" in\n4\nindices, shown in bold.\nHelp Timur by finding the number of indices where string\ns\ndiffers from \"codeforces\".\nNote that you can't reorder the characters in the string\ns\n.",
    "input_specification": "The first line contains a single integer\nt\n(\n1≤t≤1000\n) — the number of test cases.\nEach test case is one line and contains the string\ns\n, consisting of exactly\n10\nlowercase Latin characters.",
    "output_specification": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of indices where string\ns\ndiffers.",
