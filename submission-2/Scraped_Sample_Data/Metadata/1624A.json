    "description": "Polycarp got an array of integers\na[1…n]\nas a gift. Now he wants to perform a certain number of operations (possibly zero) so that all elements of the array become the same (that is, to become\na1=a2=⋯=an\n).\nFor example, let\na=[4,2,1,6,2]\n. He can perform the following operation: select indices 1, 2, and 4 and increase elements of the array in those indices by\n1\n. As a result, in one operation, he can get a new state of the array\na=[5,3,1,7,2]\n.\nWhat is the minimum number of operations it can take so that all elements of the array become equal to each other (that is, to become\na1=a2=⋯=an\n)?",
    "input_specification": "The first line of the input contains a single integer\nt\n(\n1≤t≤104\n)  — the number of test cases in the test.\nThe following are descriptions of the input test cases.\nThe first line of the description of each test case contains one integer\nn\n(\n1≤n≤50\n)  — the array\na\n.\nThe second line of the description of each test case contains\nn\nintegers\na1,a2,…,an\n(\n1≤ai≤109\n)  — elements of the array\na\n.",
    "output_specification": "For each test case, print one integer  — the minimum number of operations to make all elements of the array\na\nequal.",
