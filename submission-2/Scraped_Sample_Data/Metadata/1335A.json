    "description": "There are two sisters Alice and Betty. You have\nn\ncandies. You want to distribute these\nn\ncandies between two sisters in such a way that:\nYour task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute exactly\nn\ncandies between sisters in a way described above. Candies are indistinguishable.\nFormally, find the number of ways to represent\nn\nas the sum of\nn=a+b\n, where\na\nand\nb\nare positive integers and\na>b\n.\nYou have to answer\nt\nindependent test cases.",
    "input_specification": "The first line of the input contains one integer\nt\n(\n1≤t≤104\n) — the number of test cases. Then\nt\ntest cases follow.\nThe only line of a test case contains one integer\nn\n(\n1≤n≤2⋅109\n) — the number of candies you have.",
    "output_specification": "For each test case, print the answer — the number of ways to distribute exactly\nn\ncandies between two sisters in a way described in the problem statement. If there is no way to satisfy all the conditions, print\n0\n.",
