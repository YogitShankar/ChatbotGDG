Description:
You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
(
n≥3
) positive integers. It is known that in this array, all the numbers except one are the same (for example, in the array
[4,11,4,4]
all numbers except one are equal to
4
).
Print the index of the element that does not equal others. The numbers in the array are numbered from one.

Input Specification:
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1<=t<=100
). Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
3<=n<=100
) - the length of the array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1<=ai<=100
).
It is guaranteed that all the numbers except one in the
a
array are the same.

Output Specification:
For each test case, output a single integer - the index of the element that is not equal to others.
