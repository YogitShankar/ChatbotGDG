Input Specification:
The first line of the input contains two integer numbers
n
and
k
(
2<=n<=109
,
1<=k<=50
) - the number from which Tanya will subtract and the number of subtractions correspondingly.

Output Specification:
Print one integer number - the result of the decreasing
n
by one
k
times.
