Problem: 1370A - Maximum GCD
Link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1370/A

Description:
Let's consider all integers in the range from
1
to
n
(inclusive).
Among all pairs of distinct integers in this range, find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of integers in pair. Formally, find the maximum value of
gcd(a,b)
, where
1<=a<b<=n
.
The greatest common divisor,
gcd(a,b)
, of two positive integers
a
and
b
is the biggest integer that is a divisor of both
a
and
b
.

Input Specification:
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1<=t<=100
)  - the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2<=n<=106
).

Output Specification:
For each test case, output the maximum value of
gcd(a,b)
among all
1<=a<b<=n
.
