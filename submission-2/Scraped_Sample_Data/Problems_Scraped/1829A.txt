Link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1829/A

Description:
Timur loves codeforces. That's why he has a string
s
having length
10
made containing only lowercase Latin letters. Timur wants to know how many indices string
s
differs from the string "codeforces".
For example string
s=
"coolforsez" differs from "codeforces" in
4
indices, shown in bold.
Help Timur by finding the number of indices where string
s
differs from "codeforces".
Note that you can't reorder the characters in the string
s
.

Input Specification:
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1<=t<=1000
) - the number of test cases.
Each test case is one line and contains the string
s
, consisting of exactly
10
lowercase Latin characters.

Output Specification:
For each test case, output a single integer - the number of indices where string
s
differs.
