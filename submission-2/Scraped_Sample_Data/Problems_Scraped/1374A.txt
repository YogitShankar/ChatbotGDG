Problem: 1374A - Required Remainder
Link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1374/A

Description:
You are given three integers
x,y
and
n
. Your task is to find the maximum integer
k
such that
0<=k<=n
that
kmodx=y
, where
mod
is modulo operation. Many programming languages use percent operator % to implement it.
In other words, with given
x,y
and
n
you need to find the maximum possible integer from
0
to
n
that has the remainder
y
modulo
x
.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases. It is guaranteed that such
k
exists for each test case.

Input Specification:
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1<=t<=5â‹…104
) - the number of test cases. The next
t
lines contain test cases.
The only line of the test case contains three integers
x,y
and
n
(
2<=x<=109; 0<=y<x; y<=n<=109
).
It can be shown that such
k
always exists under the given constraints.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print the answer - maximum non-negative integer
k
such that
0<=k<=n
and
kmodx=y
. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.
