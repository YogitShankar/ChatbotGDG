Problem: 1409A - Yet Another Two Integers Problem
Link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1409/A

Description:
You are given two integers
a
and
b
.
In one move, you can choose some integer
k
from
1
to
10
and add it to
a
or subtract it from
a
. In other words, you choose an integer
k∈[1;10]
and perform
a:=a+k
or
a:=a−k
. You may use different values of
k
in different moves.
Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain
b
from
a
.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.

Input Specification:
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1<=t<=2⋅104
) - the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The only line of the test case contains two integers
a
and
b
(
1<=a,b<=109
).

Output Specification:
For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of moves required to obtain
b
from
a
.
