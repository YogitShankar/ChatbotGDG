Description:
The HR manager was disappointed again. The last applicant failed the interview the same way as 24 previous ones. "Do I give such a hard task?" - the HR manager thought. "Just raise number 5 to the power of n and get last two digits of the number. Yes, of course, n can be rather big, and one cannot find the power using a calculator, but we need people who are able to think, not just follow the instructions."
Could you pass the interview in the machine vision company in IT City?

Input Specification:
The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 2·1018) - the power in which you need to raise number 5.

Output Specification:
Output the last two digits of 5n without spaces between them.

Time Limit: 0.5 seconds
