Link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2009/A

Description:
You are given two integers
a
and
b
(
a<=b
). Over all possible integer values of
c
(
a<=c<=b
), find the minimum value of
(c−a)+(b−c)
.

Input Specification:
The first line contains
t
(
1<=t<=55
) - the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two integers
a
and
b
(
1<=a<=b<=10
).

Output Specification:
For each test case, output the minimum possible value of
(c−a)+(b−c)
on a new line.

Time Limit: 1 second
