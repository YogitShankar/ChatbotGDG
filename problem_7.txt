Title: C. Trip to the Olympiad
Statement:
In the upcoming year, there will be many team olympiads, so the teachers of "T-generation" need to assemble a team of three pupils to participate in them. Any three pupils will show a worthy result in any team olympiad. But winning the olympiad is only half the battle; first, you need to get there...
Each pupil has an independence level, expressed as an integer. In "T-generation", there is exactly one student with each independence levels from
l
to
r
, inclusive. For a team of three pupils with independence levels
a
,
b
, and
c
, the value of their team independence is equal to
(a⊕b)+(b⊕c)+(a⊕c)
, where
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Your task is to choose any trio of students with the maximum possible team independence.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case set contains two integers
l
and
r
(
0≤l,r<230
,
r−l>1
) — the minimum and maximum independence levels of the students.
For each test case set, output three pairwise distinct integers
a,b
, and
c
, such that
l≤a,b,c≤r
and the value of the expression
(a⊕b)+(b⊕c)+(a⊕c)
is maximized. If there are multiple triples with the maximum value, any of them can be output.
In the first test case, the only suitable triplet of numbers (
a,b,c
) (up to permutation) is (
0,1,2
).
In the second test case, one of the suitable triplets is (
8,7,1
), where
(8⊕7)+(7⊕1)+(8⊕1)=15+6+9=30
. It can be shown that
30
is the maximum possible value of
(a⊕b)+(b⊕c)+(a⊕c)
for
0≤a,b,c≤8
.
