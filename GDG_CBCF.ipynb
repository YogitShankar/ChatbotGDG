            "\n",
            "1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n",
            "   - In this problem, we are given the number of students around each coffee machine along a corridor.\n",
            "   - The goal is to find the maximum number of students that can be gathered around a single coffee machine after turning off lights in certain rooms.\n",
            "   - We can turn off lights in rooms to manipulate the students' positions.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Approach**:\n",
            "   - We can maintain two arrays, `lhs` and `rhs`, to store the maximum number of students that can be moved to the left and right of each coffee machine respectively.\n",
            "   - To calculate the maximum number of students that can be moved to the right of each machine, we can use the `get_right_out` function.\n",
            "   - Similarly, to calculate the maximum number of students that can be moved to the left of each machine, we can utilize the `get_left_out` function.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Detailed Steps**:\n",
            "   - Read the number of test cases, `t`.\n",
            "   - For each test case:\n",
            "     - Read the total number of coffee machines, `n`.\n",
            "     - Read the number of students around each machine into array `a`.\n",
            "     - Calculate the maximum number of students that can be moved to the right of each machine using `get_right_out` function.\n",
            "     - Calculate the maximum number of students that can be moved to the left of each machine using `get_left_out` function.\n",
            "     - Output the sum of `lhs[i] + a[i] + rhs[i+1]` for each machine.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Code Explanation**:\n",
            "   - The provided code snippet implements the above approach using the `get_right_out`, `get_left_out`, and `solve` functions.\n",
            "   - The `get_right_out` function calculates the maximum number of students that can be moved to the right of each machine.\n",
            "   - The `get_left_out` function calculates the maximum number of students that can be moved to the left of each machine.\n",
            "   - The `solve` function reads input, calculates the required values, and outputs the result.\n",

            "### Explanation of `get_right_out` Function:\n",
            "1. **Aim**: The `get_right_out` function is responsible for calculating the maximum number of students that can be gathered to the right of each coffee machine by manipulating the positions of students through turning off lights in rooms.\n",
