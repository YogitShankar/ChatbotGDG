Title: D. Counting Pairs

Statement:
You are given a sequence
a
, consisting of
n
integers, where the
i
-th element of the sequence is equal to
a
i
. You are also given two integers
x
and
y
(
x≤y
).
A pair of integers
(i,j)
is considered interesting if the following conditions are met:
Your task is to determine the number of interesting pairs of integers for the given sequence
a
.
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines:
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of
n
across all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
For each test case, output one integer — the number of interesting pairs of integers for the given sequence
a
.
In the first example, there are
4
interesting pairs of integers:

Input Specification:
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines:
The first line contains three integers
n,x,y
(
3≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤x≤y≤2⋅
10
14
);
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
