Imagine you have
n
light bulbs numbered
1,2,…,n
. Initially, all bulbs are on. To flip the state of a bulb means to turn it off if it used to be on, and to turn it on otherwise.
Next, you do the following:
for each
i=1,2,…,n
, flip the state of all bulbs
j
such that
j
is divisible by
i
†
.
After performing all operations, there will be several bulbs that are still on. Your goal is to make this number exactly
k
.
Find the smallest suitable
n
such that after performing the operations there will be exactly
k
bulbs on. We can show that an answer always exists.

An integer
x

.Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single integer
k
(
1≤k≤
10
18
).For each test case, output
n
— the minimum number of bulbs.In the first test case, the minimum number of bulbs is
2
. Let's denote the state of all bulbs with an array, where
1
corresponds to a turned on bulb, and
0
corresponds to a turned off bulb. Initially, the array is
[1,1]
.In the end, there are
k=1
bulbs on. We can also show that the answer cannot be less than
2
.In the second test case, the minimum number of bulbs is
5
. Initially, the array is
[1,1,1,1,1]
.In the end, there are
k=3
bulbs on. We can also show that the answer cannot be smaller than
5
.
