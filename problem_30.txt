Title: C. Bewitching Stargazer
Statement:
Iris looked at the stars and a beautiful problem emerged in her mind. She is inviting you to solve it so that a meteor shower is believed to form.
There are
n
stars in the sky, arranged in a row. Iris has a telescope, which she uses to look at the stars.
Initially, Iris observes stars in the segment
[1,n]
, and she has a lucky value of
0
. Iris wants to look for the star in the middle position for each segment
[l,r]
that she observes. So the following recursive procedure is used:
Iris is a bit lazy. She defines her laziness by an integer
k
: as the observation progresses, she will not continue to observe any segment
[l,r]
with a length strictly less than
k
. In this case, please predict her final lucky value.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤105
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤k≤n≤2⋅109
).
For each test case, output a single integer — the final lucky value.
In the first test case, at the beginning, Iris observes
[1,7]
. Since
[1,7]
has an odd length, she aims at star
4
and therefore increases her lucky value by
4
. Then it is split into
2
new segments:
[1,3]
and
[5,7]
. The segment
[1,3]
again has an odd length, so Iris aims at star
2
and increases her lucky value by
2
. Then it is split into
2
new segments:
[1,1]
and
[3,3]
, both having a length less than
2
, so no further observation is conducted. For range
[5,7]
, the progress is similar and the lucky value eventually increases by
6
. Therefore, the final lucky value is
4+2+6=12
.
In the last test case, Iris finally observes all the stars and the final lucky value is
1+2+⋯+8765432=38416403456028
.
