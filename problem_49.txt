Title: D. Counting Pairs
Statement:
You are given a sequence
a
, consisting of
n
integers, where the
i
-th element of the sequence is equal to
ai
. You are also given two integers
x
and
y
(
x≤y
).
A pair of integers
(i,j)
is considered interesting if the following conditions are met:
Your task is to determine the number of interesting pairs of integers for the given sequence
a
.
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines:
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of
n
across all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
For each test case, output one integer — the number of interesting pairs of integers for the given sequence
a
.
In the first example, there are
4
interesting pairs of integers:
Input Specification:
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines:
The first line contains three integers
n,x,y
(
3≤n≤2⋅105
,
1≤x≤y≤2⋅1014
);
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
).
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of
n
across all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output Specification:
Output
For each test case, output one integer — the number of interesting pairs of integers for the given sequence
a
