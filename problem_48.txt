Title: E. Best Price
Statement:
A batch of Christmas trees has arrived at the largest store in Berland.
n
customers have already come to the store, wanting to buy them.
Before the sales begin, the store needs to determine the price for one tree (the price is the same for all customers). To do this, the store has some information about each customer.
For the
i
-th customer, two integers
ai
and
bi
are known, which define their behavior:
Your task is to calculate the maximum possible earnings for the store, given that it can receive no more than
k
negative reviews.
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
;
0≤k≤n
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤2⋅109
).
The third line contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
1≤bi≤2⋅109
;
ai<bi
).
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum possible earnings for the store, given that it can receive no more than
k
negative reviews.
Consider the example from the statement:
