Title: A. Tender Carpenter
Statement:
In his dream, Cocoly would go on a long holiday with no worries around him. So he would try out for many new things, such as... being a carpenter. To learn it well, Cocoly decides to become an apprentice of Master, but in front of him lies a hard task waiting for him to solve.
Cocoly is given an array
a1,a2,…,an
. Master calls a set of integers
S
stable if and only if, for any possible
u
,
v
, and
w
from the set
S
(note that
u
,
v
, and
w
do not necessarily have to be pairwise distinct), sticks of length
u
,
v
, and
w
can form a non-degenerate triangle
∗
.
Cocoly is asked to partition the array
a
into several (possibly,
1
or
n
) non-empty continuous subsegments
†
, such that: for each of the subsegments, the set containing all the elements in it is stable.
Master wants Cocoly to partition
a
in at least two different
‡
ways. You have to help him determine whether it is possible.
∗
A triangle with side lengths
x
,
y
, and
z
is called non-degenerate if and only if:
†
A sequence
b
is a subsegment of a sequence
c
if
b
can be obtained from
c
by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
‡
Two partitions are considered different if and only if at least one of the following holds:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤200
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤200
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤105
) — the elements in the array
a
.
For each test case, print
YES
if there are at least two ways to partition
a
, and
NO
otherwise.
You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings
yEs
,
yes
,
Yes
, and
YES
will be recognized as positive responses.
In the first test case, here are two possible partitions:
Note that some other partitions also satisfy the constraints, such as
[2],[3],[5],[7]
and
[2],[3],[5,7]
.
In the second test case, Cocoly can only partition each element as a single subsegment, resulting in
[115],[9],[2],[28]
. Since we only have one possible partition, the answer is
NO
.
In the third test case, please note that the partition
[8,4],[1],[6],[2]
does not satisfy the constraints, because
{8,4}
is not a stable set: sticks of lengths
4
,
4
, and
8
cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.
Input Specification:
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤200
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤200
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a

a
.
Output Specification:
