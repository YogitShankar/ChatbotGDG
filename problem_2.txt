Title: B. Digits

Statement:
Artem wrote the digit
d
on the board exactly
n!
times in a row. So, he got the number
dddddd…ddd
(exactly
n!
digits).
Now he is curious about which odd digits from
1
to
9
divide the number written on the board.
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The next
t
test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers
n
and
d
(
2≤n≤
10
9
,
1≤d≤9
).
For each test case, output the odd digits in ascending order that divide the number written on the board.
The factorial of a positive integer
n
(
n!
) is the product of all integers from
1
to
n
. For example, the factorial of
5
is
1⋅2⋅3⋅4⋅5=120
.
