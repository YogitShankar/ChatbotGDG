Title: D. Unique Median
Statement:

An array
b
of
m
integers is called good if, when it is sorted,
b⌊
m+1
2
⌋=b⌈
m+1
2
⌉
. In other words,
b
is good if both of its medians are equal. In particular,
⌊
m+1
2
⌋=⌈
m+1
2
⌉
when
m
is odd, so
b
is guaranteed to be good if it has an odd length.
You are given an array
a
of
n
integers. Calculate the number of good subarrays
∗
in
a
.
∗
An array
x
is a subarray of an array
y
if
x
can be obtained from
y
by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
) — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤10
) — the given array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
105
.
For each test case, output a single integer representing the number of good subarrays in
a
.
In the first case, every subarray is good since all its elements are equal to
1
.
In the second case, an example of a good subarray is
b=[10,2,3,3]
. When it is sorted,
b=[2,3,3,10]
, so
b⌊
4+1
2
⌋=b⌈
4+1
2
⌉=b2=b3=3
. Another example would be
b=[1,10,2]
. On the other hand,
b=[1,10]
is not good as its two medians are
1
and
10
, which are not equal.
