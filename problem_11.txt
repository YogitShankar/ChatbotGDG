Title: F1. Xor of Median (Easy Version)
Statement:

This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, the constraints on
t
,
k
, and
m
are lower. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.
A sequence
a
of
n
integers is called good if the following condition holds:
You are given integers
n
and
m
. Calculate the value of the bitwise XOR of the median
∗
of all good sequences
a
of length
n
with
0≤ai<m
.
Note that the value of
n
can be very large, so you are given its binary representation instead.
∗
The median of a sequence
a
of length
n
is defined as the
⌊
n+1
2
⌋
-th smallest value in the sequence.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤50
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
k
and
m
(
1≤k≤200
,
1≤m≤500
) — the number of bits in
n
and the upper bound on the elements in sequence
a
.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string of length
k
 — the binary representation of
n
with no leading zeros.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
k
over all test cases does not exceed
200
.
For each test case, output a single integer representing the bitwise XOR of the median of all good sequences
a
of length
n
where
0≤ai<m
.
In the first example,
n=102=2
and
m=3
. All possible sequences with elements less than
m
are:
[0,0]
,
[0,1]
,
[0,2]
,
[1,0]
,
[1,1]
,
[1,2]
,
[2,0]
,
[2,1]
,
[2,2]
. All of them are good, so the answer is:
0⊕0⊕0⊕0⊕1⊕1⊕0⊕1⊕2=3
.
In the second example,
n=112=3
and
m=3
. Some good sequences are
[2,2,2]
,
[1,0,1]
, and
[2,0,1]
. However, a sequence
[2,0,0]
is not good, because
cnt0=2
,
cnt2=1
. Therefore, if we set
i=0
and
j=2
,
i<j
holds, but
cnti≤cntj
does not.
