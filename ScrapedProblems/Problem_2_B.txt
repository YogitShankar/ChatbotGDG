Title: B. The least round way

There is a square matrix n × n, consisting of non-negative integer numbers. You should find such a way on it that
Moreover, if we multiply together all the numbers along the way, the result should be the least "round". In other words, it should end in the least possible number of zeros.
The first line contains an integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), n is the size of the matrix. Then follow n lines containing the matrix elements (non-negative integer numbers not exceeding 109).
In the first line print the least number of trailing zeros. In the second line print the correspondent way itself.
