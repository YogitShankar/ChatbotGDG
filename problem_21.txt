Title: B. Crafting
Statement:

There are
n
different types of magical materials, numbered from
1
to
n
. Initially, you have
ai
units of material
i
for each
i
from
1
to
n
. You are allowed to perform the following operation:
You are trying to craft an artifact using these materials. To successfully craft the artifact, you must have at least
bi
units of material
i
for each
i
from
1
to
n
. Determine if it is possible to craft the artifact by performing the operation any number of times (including zero).
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of types of materials.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤109
) — the amount of each material
i
that you currently hold.
The third line of each test case contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
0≤bi≤109
) — the amount of each material
i
needed to produce the artifact.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
For each test case, print a single line containing either "YES" or "NO", representing whether or not the artifact can be crafted.
You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
In the first test case, perform an operation on material
1
. After doing so, we will have exactly the required resources:
1
unit of material
1
, and
4
units each of materials
2
and
3
.
In the second test case, it can be shown that no matter how the operations are performed, it is impossible to craft the artifact.
In the third test case, we can perform the operation on material
1
twice. After these operations, we will have
3
units of material
1
and
8
units of material
2
, which is more than enough to craft the artifact.
