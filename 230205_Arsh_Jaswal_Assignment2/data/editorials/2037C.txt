As 1+3>2, any two numbers with same parity sum up to a composite number. Now you only have to find one odd number and one even number that sum up to a composite number. One can manually verify that there is no such pair in n≤4, but in n=5 there exists (4,5) which sums up to 9, a composite number. Code (Python) for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    if n < 5:
        print(-1)
        continue
    for i in range(2,n+1,2):
        if i != 4:
            print(i,end=" ")
    print("4 5",end=" ")
    for i in range(1,n+1,2):
        if i != 5:
            print(i, end = " ")
    print()
