You are given a permutation∗ p of length n.
Find a permutation q of length n that minimizes the number of pairs (i,j) (1≤i≤j≤n) such that pi+pi+1+…+pj=qi+qi+1+…+qj.
∗A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
The first line contains t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains n (1≤n≤2⋅105).
The following line contains n space-separated integers p1,p2,…,pn (1≤pi≤n) — denoting the permutation p of length n.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, output one line containing any permutation of length n (the permutation q) such that q minimizes the number of pairs.
For the first test, there exists only one pair (i,j) (1≤i≤j≤n) such that pi+pi+1+…+pj=qi+qi+1+…+qj, which is (1,2). It can be proven that no such q exists for which there are no pairs.
