You have an array a of n integers. 
You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers i, j, x (1≤i≤j≤n) and assign all elements of the array with indexes from i to j the value x. The price of this operation depends on the selected indices and is equal to (j−i+1) burles. 
For example, the array is equal to [1,2,3,4,5,1]. If we choose i=2,j=4,x=8, then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to [1,8,8,8,5,1].
What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements of the array equal?
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.
The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the size of the array.
The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n) — array elements.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be shown that this can always be done.
