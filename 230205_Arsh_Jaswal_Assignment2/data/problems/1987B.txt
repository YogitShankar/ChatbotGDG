You are given an array of integers a of length n. 
You can apply the following operation any number of times (maybe, zero): 
Find the minimum number of coins needed to make a non-decreasing. That is, a1≤a2≤…≤an.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤105) — the length of the array a.
The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array a.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins needed to make a non-decreasing.
In the first test case, a is already sorted, so you don't have to spend any coins.
In the second test case, the optimal sequence of operations is:
