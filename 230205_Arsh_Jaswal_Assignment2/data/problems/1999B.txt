Suneet and Slavic play a card game. The rules of the game are as follows:
Since Suneet and Slavic aren't best friends, you need to calculate the number of ways the game could happen that Suneet would end up as the winner.
For a better understanding, please check the notes section.
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains 4 integers a1, a2, b1, b2 (1≤a1,a2,b1,b2≤10) where a1 and a2 represent the cards Suneet has, and b1 and b2 represent the cards Slavic has, respectively.
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of games Suneet would win considering all possible games.
Consider the first test case when Slavic starts with the cards that have the values 2 and 6, and Suneet starts with cards that have the values 3 and 8. The game could happen in 4 different ways:
