Reve has two integers n and k.
Let p be a permutation† of length n. Let c be an array of length n−k+1 such that ci=max(pi,…,pi+k−1)+min(pi,…,pi+k−1). Let the cost of the permutation p be the maximum element of c.
Koxia wants you to construct a permutation with the minimum possible cost.
† A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤2000) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1≤k≤n≤2⋅105).
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, output n integers p1,p2,…,pn, which is a permutation with minimal cost. If there is more than one permutation with minimal cost, you may output any of them.
In the first test case,
Therefore, the cost is max(6,4,6)=6. It can be proven that this is the minimal cost.
