    "description": "Kristina has an array a, called a template, consisting of n integers. She also has m strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The strings are numbered from 1 to m. She wants to check which strings match the template.\nA string s is considered to match the template if all of the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied: \nFor example, if a = [3,5,2,1,3], then the string \"abfda\" matches the template, while the string \"afbfa\" does not, since the character \"f\" corresponds to both numbers 1 and 5.\nThe first line of input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nThe following descriptions are for the test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of elements in the array a.\nThe second line of each test case contains exactly n integers ai (−109≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array a.\nThe third line of each test case contains a single integer m (1≤m≤2⋅105) — the number of strings to check for template matching.\nFollowing are m strings, each containing a non-empty string sj (1≤|sj|≤2⋅105), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105, and that the sum of the lengths of all strings does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, output m lines. On the i-th line (1≤i≤m) output: \nYou may output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).\nThe first test case is explained in the problem statement.",
