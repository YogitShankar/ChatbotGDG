    "description": "Alex thinks some array is good if there exists some element that can be represented as the sum of all other elements (the sum of all other elements is 0 if there are no other elements). For example, the array [1,6,3,2] is good since 1+3+2=6. Furthermore, the array [0] is also good. However, the arrays [1,2,3,4] and [1] are not good.\nAlex has an array a1,a2,…,an. Help him count the number of good non-empty prefixes of the array a. In other words, count the number of integers i (1≤i≤n) such that the length i prefix (i.e. a1,a2,…,ai) is good.\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of elements in the array.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105. \nFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of good non-empty prefixes of the array a.\nIn the fourth test case, the array has five prefixes: \nAs you can see, three of them are good, so the answer is 3.",
