    "description": "You are given n points with integer coordinates on a coordinate axis OX. The coordinate of the i-th point is xi. All points' coordinates are distinct and given in strictly increasing order.\nFor each point i, you can do the following operation no more than once: take this point and move it by 1 to the left or to the right (i..e., you can change its coordinate xi to xi−1 or to xi+1). In other words, for each point, you choose (separately) its new coordinate. For the i-th point, it can be either xi−1, xi or xi+1.\nYour task is to determine if you can move some points as described above in such a way that the new set of points forms a consecutive segment of integers, i. e. for some integer l the coordinates of points should be equal to l,l+1,…,l+n−1.\nNote that the resulting points should have distinct coordinates.\nYou have to answer t independent test cases.\nThe first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of points in the set x.\nThe second line of the test case contains n integers x1<x2<…<xn (1≤xi≤106), where xi is the coordinate of the i-th point.\nIt is guaranteed that the points are given in strictly increasing order (this also means that all coordinates are distinct). It is also guaranteed that the sum of n does not exceed 2⋅105 (∑n≤2⋅105).\nFor each test case, print the answer — if the set of points from the test case can be moved to form a consecutive segment of integers, print YES, otherwise print NO.",
