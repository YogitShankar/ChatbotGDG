    "description": "Superultra, a little red panda, desperately wants primogems. In his dreams, a voice tells him that he must solve the following task to obtain a lifetime supply of primogems. Help Superultra!\nConstruct a permutation∗ p of length n such that pi+pi+1 is composite† over all 1≤i≤n−1. If it's not possible, output −1.\n∗A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).\n†An integer x is composite if it has at least one other divisor besides 1 and x. For example, 4 is composite because 2 is a divisor.\nThe first line contains t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nEach test case contains an integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the permutation.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, if it's not possible to construct p, output −1 on a new line. Otherwise, output n integers p1,p2,…,pn on a new line.\nIn the first example, it can be shown that all permutation of size 3 contain two adjacent elements whose sum is prime. For example, in the permutation [2,3,1] the sum 2+3=5 is prime.\nIn the second example, we can verify that the sample output is correct because 1+8, 8+7, 7+3, 3+6, 6+2, 2+4, and 4+5 are all composite. There may be other constructions that are correct.",
