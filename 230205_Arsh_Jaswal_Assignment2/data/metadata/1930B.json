    "description": "You are given a positive integer n.\nFind a permutation† p of length n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1≤i,j<n; i≠j) such that pi divides pj and pi+1 divides pj+1.\nRefer to the Notes section for some examples.\nUnder the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p exists.\n† A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤103) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3≤n≤105) — the length of the permutation p.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.\nFor each test case, output p1,p2,…,pn.\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.\nIn the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and j=3. Then p1=1 divides p3=3 and p2=2 divides p4=4. Note that the permutation p=[3,4,2,1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose i=3 and j=2. Then p3=2 divides p2=4 and p4=1 divides p3=2.\nIn the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6 permutations of length 3 are valid.",
