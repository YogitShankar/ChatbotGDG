Title: D. Gifts Order
Statement:
"T-Generation" has decided to purchase gifts for various needs; thus, they have
n
different sweaters numbered from
1
to
n
. The
i
-th sweater has a size of
ai
. Now they need to send some subsegment of sweaters to an olympiad. It is necessary that the sweaters fit as many people as possible, but without having to take too many of them.
They need to choose two indices
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) to maximize the convenience equal to
max(al,al+1,…,ar)−min(al,al+1,…,ar)−(r−l),
that is, the range of sizes minus the number of sweaters.
Sometimes the sizes of the sweaters change; it is known that there have been
q
changes, in each change, the size of the
p
-th sweater becomes
x
.
Help the "T-Generation" team and determine the maximum convenience among all possible pairs
(l,r)
initially, as well as after each size change.
Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n,q≤2⋅105
) — the number of sweaters and the number of size changes.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
) — the sizes of the sweaters.
Each of the following
q
lines of each test case contains two integers
p
and
x
(
1≤p≤n
,
1≤x≤109
) — the next size change.
It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of
n
and the sum of the values of
q
across all test cases do not exceed
2⋅105
.
For each test case, output the maximum value of convenience among all possible pairs
(l,r)
before any actions, as well as after each size change.
Consider the first test case.
