Settime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a positive integer \ud835\udc58k and a set \ud835\udc46S of all integers from \ud835\udc59l to \ud835\udc5fr (inclusive).You can perform the following two-step operation any number of times (possibly zero): First, choose a number \ud835\udc65x from the set \ud835\udc46S, such that there are at least \ud835\udc58k multiples of \ud835\udc65x in \ud835\udc46S (including \ud835\udc65x itself);  Then, remove \ud835\udc65x from \ud835\udc46S (note that nothing else is removed).Find the maximum possible number of operations that can be performed.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer \ud835\udc61t (1\u2264\ud835\udc61\u22641041\u2264t\u2264104)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains three integers \ud835\udc59l, \ud835\udc5fr, and \ud835\udc58k (1\u2264\ud835\udc59\u2264\ud835\udc5f\u22641091\u2264l\u2264r\u2264109, 1\u2264\ud835\udc58\u2264\ud835\udc5f\u2212\ud835\udc59+11\u2264k\u2264r\u2212l+1)\u00a0\u2014 the minimum integer in \ud835\udc46S, the maximum integer in \ud835\udc46S, and the parameter \ud835\udc58k.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum possible number of operations that can be performed.ExampleInputCopy83 9 24 9 17 9 22 10 2154 220 2147 294 2998 24435 31 1000000000 2OutputCopy2\n6\n0\n4\n0\n1\n7148\n500000000\nNoteIn the first test case, initially, \ud835\udc46={3,4,5,6,7,8,9}S={3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. One possible optimal sequence of operations is:   Choose \ud835\udc65=4x=4 for the first operation, since there are two multiples of 44 in \ud835\udc46S: 44 and 88. \ud835\udc46S becomes equal to {3,5,6,7,8,9}{3,5,6,7,8,9};  Choose \ud835\udc65=3x=3 for the second operation, since there are three multiples of 33 in \ud835\udc46S: 33, 66, and 99. \ud835\udc46S becomes equal to {5,6,7,8,9}{5,6,7,8,9}. In the second test case, initially, \ud835\udc46={4,5,6,7,8,9}S={4,5,6,7,8,9}. One possible optimal sequence of operations is:   Choose \ud835\udc65=5x=5, \ud835\udc46S becomes equal to {4,6,7,8,9}{4,6,7,8,9};  Choose \ud835\udc65=6x=6, \ud835\udc46S becomes equal to {4,7,8,9}{4,7,8,9};  Choose \ud835\udc65=4x=4, \ud835\udc46S becomes equal to {7,8,9}{7,8,9};  Choose \ud835\udc65=8x=8, \ud835\udc46S becomes equal to {7,9}{7,9};  Choose \ud835\udc65=7x=7, \ud835\udc46S becomes equal to {9}{9};  Choose \ud835\udc65=9x=9, \ud835\udc46S becomes equal to {}{}. In the third test case, initially, \ud835\udc46={7,8,9}S={7,8,9}. For each \ud835\udc65x in \ud835\udc46S, no multiple of \ud835\udc65x other than \ud835\udc65x itself can be found in \ud835\udc46S. Since \ud835\udc58=2k=2, you can perform no operations.In the fourth test case, initially, \ud835\udc46={2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}S={2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}. One possible optimal sequence of operations is:   Choose \ud835\udc65=2x=2, \ud835\udc46S becomes equal to {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};  Choose \ud835\udc65=4x=4, \ud835\udc46S becomes equal to {3,5,6,7,8,9,10}{3,5,6,7,8,9,10};  Choose \ud835\udc65=3x=3, \ud835\udc46S becomes equal to {5,6,7,8,9,10}{5,6,7,8,9,10};  Choose \ud835\udc65=5x=5, \ud835\udc46S becomes equal to {6,7,8,9,10}{6,7,8,9,10}...."
