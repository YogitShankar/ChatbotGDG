Common Generatortime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor two integers \ud835\udc65x and \ud835\udc66y (\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66\u22652x,y\u22652), we will say that \ud835\udc65x is a generator of \ud835\udc66y if and only if \ud835\udc65x can be transformed to \ud835\udc66y by performing the following operation some number of times (possibly zero):  Choose a divisor \ud835\udc51d (\ud835\udc51\u22652d\u22652) of \ud835\udc65x, then increase \ud835\udc65x by \ud835\udc51d. For example,   33 is a generator of 88 since we can perform the following operations: 3\u2212\u2192\u2212\ud835\udc51=36\u2212\u2192\u2212\ud835\udc51=283\u2192d=36\u2192d=28;  44 is a generator of 1010 since we can perform the following operations: 4\u2212\u2192\u2212\ud835\udc51=48\u2212\u2192\u2212\ud835\udc51=2104\u2192d=48\u2192d=210;  55 is not a generator of 66 since we cannot transform 55 into 66 with the operation above. Now, Kevin gives you an array \ud835\udc4ea consisting of \ud835\udc5bn pairwise distinct integers (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\u22652ai\u22652).You have to find an integer \ud835\udc65\u22652x\u22652 such that for each 1\u2264\ud835\udc56\u2264\ud835\udc5b1\u2264i\u2264n, \ud835\udc65x is a generator of \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56ai, or determine that such an integer does not exist.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer \ud835\udc61t (1\u2264\ud835\udc61\u22641041\u2264t\u2264104)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer \ud835\udc5bn (1\u2264\ud835\udc5b\u22641051\u2264n\u2264105)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array \ud835\udc4ea.The second line contains \ud835\udc5bn integers \ud835\udc4e1,\ud835\udc4e2,\u2026,\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5ba1,a2,\u2026,an (2\u2264\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\u22644\u22c51052\u2264ai\u22644\u22c5105)\u00a0\u2014 the elements in the array \ud835\udc4ea. It is guaranteed that the elements are pairwise distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of \ud835\udc5bn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer \ud835\udc65x\u00a0\u2014 the integer you found. Print \u22121\u22121 if there does not exist a valid \ud835\udc65x.If there are multiple answers, you may output any of them.ExampleInputCopy438 9 1042 3 4 52147 15453 6 8 25 100000OutputCopy2\n-1\n7\n3\nNoteIn the first test case, for \ud835\udc65=2x=2:  22 is a generator of 88, since we can perform the following operations: 2\u2212\u2192\u2212\ud835\udc51=24\u2212\u2192\u2212\ud835\udc51=482\u2192d=24\u2192d=48;  22 is a generator of 99, since we can perform the following operations: 2\u2212\u2192\u2212\ud835\udc51=24\u2212\u2192\u2212\ud835\udc51=26\u2212\u2192\u2212\ud835\udc51=392\u2192d=24\u2192d=26\u2192d=39.  22 is a generator of 1010, since we can perform the following operations: 2\u2212\u2192\u2212\ud835\udc51=24\u2212\u2192\u2212\ud835\udc51=26\u2212\u2192\u2212\ud835\udc51=28\u2212\u2192\u2212\ud835\udc51=2102\u2192d=24\u2192d=26\u2192d=28\u2192d=210. In the second test case, it can be proven that it is impossible to find a common generator of the four integers...."
