Replacementtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a binary string\u2217\u2217 \ud835\udc60s of length \ud835\udc5bn, and Iris gives you another binary string \ud835\udc5fr of length \ud835\udc5b\u22121n\u22121.Iris is going to play a game with you. During the game, you will perform \ud835\udc5b\u22121n\u22121 operations on \ud835\udc60s. In the \ud835\udc56i-th operation (1\u2264\ud835\udc56\u2264\ud835\udc5b\u221211\u2264i\u2264n\u22121):  First, you choose an index \ud835\udc58k such that 1\u2264\ud835\udc58\u2264|\ud835\udc60|\u221211\u2264k\u2264|s|\u22121 and \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\u2260\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58+1sk\u2260sk+1. If it is impossible to choose such an index, you lose;  Then, you replace \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58+1sksk+1 with \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56ri. Note that this decreases the length of \ud835\udc60s by 11. If all the \ud835\udc5b\u22121n\u22121 operations are performed successfully, you win.Determine whether it is possible for you to win this game.\u2217\u2217A binary string is a string where each character is either \ud835\udff60 or \ud835\udff71.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer \ud835\udc61t (1\u2264\ud835\udc61\u22641041\u2264t\u2264104) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer \ud835\udc5bn (2\u2264\ud835\udc5b\u22641052\u2264n\u2264105)\u00a0\u2014 the length of \ud835\udc60s.The second line contains the binary string \ud835\udc60s of length \ud835\udc5bn (\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56=\ud835\udff6si=0 or \ud835\udff71).The third line contains the binary string \ud835\udc5fr of length \ud835\udc5b\u22121n\u22121 (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56=\ud835\udff6ri=0 or \ud835\udff71).It is guaranteed that the sum of \ud835\udc5bn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.OutputFor each test case, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if you can win the game, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.ExampleInputCopy621102011411010016111110100006010010110108100100100010010OutputCopyNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNoteIn the first test case, you cannot perform the first operation. Thus, you lose the game.In the second test case, you can choose \ud835\udc58=1k=1 in the only operation, and after that, \ud835\udc60s becomes equal to \ud835\udff71. Thus, you win the game.In the third test case, you can perform the following operations: \ud835\udff7\ud835\udff7\ud835\udff6\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\ud835\udff7\u2212\u2192\u2212\u2212\ud835\udc5f1=\ud835\udff6\ud835\udff7\ud835\udff6\ud835\udff7\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u2212\u2192\u2212\u2212\ud835\udc5f2=\ud835\udff6\ud835\udff7\ud835\udff6\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u2212\u2192\u2212\u2212\ud835\udc5f3=\ud835\udff7\ud835\udff7110_1\u2192r1=0101_\u2192r2=010_\u2192r3=11...."
