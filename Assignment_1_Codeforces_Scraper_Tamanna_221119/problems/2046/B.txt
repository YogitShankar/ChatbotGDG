B. Move Back at a Costtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output You are given an array of integers 𝑎a of length 𝑛n. You can perform the following operation zero or more times:   In one operation choose an index 𝑖i (1≤𝑖≤𝑛1≤i≤n), assign 𝑎𝑖:=𝑎𝑖+1ai:=ai+1, and then move 𝑎𝑖ai to the back of the array (to the rightmost position). For example, if 𝑎=[3,5,1,9]a=[3,5,1,9], and you choose 𝑖=2i=2, the array becomes [3,1,9,6][3,1,9,6]. Find the lexicographically smallest∗∗ array you can get by performing these operations.∗∗An array 𝑐c is lexicographically smaller than an array 𝑑d if and only if one of the following holds:   𝑐c is a prefix of 𝑑d, but 𝑐≠𝑑c≠d; or  in the first position where 𝑐c and 𝑑d differ, the array 𝑐c has a smaller element than the corresponding element in 𝑑d.  InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡t (1≤𝑡≤1041≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains a single integer 𝑛n (1≤𝑛≤1051≤n≤105), the length of the array.The second line contains 𝑛n integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛a1,a2,…,an (1≤𝑎𝑖≤1091≤ai≤109), the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛n over all test cases does not exceed 105105. OutputFor each test case, print the lexicographically smallest array you can get.ExampleInputCopy332 1 351 2 2 1 461 2 3 6 5 4OutputCopy1 3 3
