D. For the Emperor!time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output In Ancient Rome, a plan to defeat the barbarians was developed, but for its implementation, each city must be informed about it.The northern part of the Roman Empire consists of 𝑛n cities connected by 𝑚m one-way roads. Initially, the 𝑖i-th city has 𝑎𝑖ai messengers, and each messenger can freely move between cities following the existing roads. A messenger can carry a copy of the plan with him and inform the cities he visits, and can make unlimited copies for other messengers in the city he is currently in.At the start, you will produce some number of plans and deliver them to messengers of your choice. Your goal is to make sure that every city is visited by a messenger with a plan. Find the smallest number of the plans you need to produce originally, so that the messengers will deliver them to every city, or determine that it is impossible to do so at all.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡t (1≤𝑡≤1001≤t≤100). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains two integers 𝑛n and 𝑚m (2≤𝑛≤2002≤n≤200, 1≤𝑚≤8001≤m≤800) — the number of cities and roads.The second line contains 𝑛n non-negative integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛a1,a2,…,an (0≤𝑎𝑖≤𝑛0≤ai≤n) — the initial number of messengers in each city.Each of the following 𝑚m lines contains two integers 𝑢u and 𝑣v (1≤𝑢,𝑣≤𝑛,𝑢≠𝑣1≤u,v≤n,u≠v), indicating that there is a one-way road from city 𝑢u to city 𝑣v. The roads may repeat.It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛n over all test cases does not exceed 200200.  It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑚m over all test cases does not exceed 800800. OutputOutput a single line containing a single integer — the smallest number of messengers you need to give a copy of the plan in the beginning, or −1−1 if it is not possible to inform all cities.ExampleInputCopy27 62 1 0 1 2 3 41 21 32 42 53 63 74 41 1 1 11 21 32 43 4OutputCopy2
