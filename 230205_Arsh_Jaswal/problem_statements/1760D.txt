Problem Title: D. Challenging Valleys

time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You are given an array a[0…n−1] of n integers. This array is called a "valley" if there exists exactly one subarray a[l…r] such that:
Here are three examples:
The first image shows the array [3,2,2,1,2,2,3], it is a valley because only subarray with indices l=r=3 satisfies the condition.
The second image shows the array [1,1,1,2,3,3,4,5,6,6,6], it is a valley because only subarray with indices l=0,r=2 satisfies the codition.
The third image shows the array [1,2,3,4,3,2,1], it is not a valley because two subarrays l=r=0 and l=r=6 that satisfy the condition.
You are asked whether the given array is a valley or not.
Note that we consider the array to be indexed from 0.
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains n integers ai (1≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases is smaller than 2⋅105.
For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if the array is a valley, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).
The first three test cases are explained in the statement.
