You are given an integer n.
Your task is to find two positive (greater than 0) integers a and b such that a+b=n and the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b is the minimum among all possible values of a and b. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤109).
For each test case, print two positive integers a and b — the answer to the problem. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
In the second example, there are 8 possible pairs of a and b:
In the third example, there are 5 possible pairs of a and b:
