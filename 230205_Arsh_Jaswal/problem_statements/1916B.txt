A certain number 1≤x≤109 is chosen. You are given two integers a and b, which are the two largest divisors of the number x. At the same time, the condition 1≤a<b<x is satisfied.
For the given numbers a, b, you need to find the value of x.
† The number y is a divisor of the number x if there is an integer k such that x=y⋅k.
Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.
The only line of each test cases contains two integers a, b (1≤a<b≤109).
It is guaranteed that a, b are the two largest divisors for some number 1≤x≤109.
For each test case, output the number x, such that a and b are the two largest divisors of the number x.
If there are several answers, print any of them.
For the first test case, all divisors less than 6 are equal to [1,2,3], among them the two largest will be 2 and 3.
For the third test case, all divisors less than 33 are equal to [1,3,11], among them the two largest will be 3 and 11.
For the fifth test case, all divisors less than 20 are equal to [1,2,4,5,10], among them the two largest will be 5 and 10.
For the sixth test case, all divisors less than 12 are equal to [1,2,3,4,6], among them the two largest will be 4 and 6.
